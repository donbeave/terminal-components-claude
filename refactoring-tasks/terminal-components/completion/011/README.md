# TASK-011 — Complete semantic palettes overrides and ASCII glyph policy

## Goal

Semantic theme overrides, capability projection and complete opt-in ASCII conversion preserve exact paint.

## Context

This package describes future implementation, not work authorized by the current planning goal. UI authority is immutable oracle `02f5294bfdbf38004cc49130d0aff1d01f31434c`; architectural starting source is `7b27732a8c3c131760ec3438f641cb3c11343a42`. Existing source/tests establish preservation obligations, not oracle parity. Required predecessors: `TASK-006`, `TASK-008`, `TASK-073`. Receipt acceptance and integrated source ancestry are both mandatory.

Read before editing:

- `/task/trusted/obligations.md` in full, including every assigned historical clause.
- `/task/trusted/source-witnesses.md` in full; its finite case IDs, source anchors, inputs, axes and exact checkpoints are mandatory host-frozen proof inputs, not executor-selected examples.
- `/task/trusted/source-obligations.tsv` in full; its exact source-qualified clauses, dispositions and task/check mappings are normative, not optional background.
- `/work/docs/refactoring-plan/components.md`, `architecture.md`, `architecture-adjudication.md` and `proof-contract.md`.
- Every pinned oracle/main source and existing test named in the trusted family/historical rows.

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The protected host has accepted TASK-001/070/071/072 products, sealed complete baseline TASK-006 and exact inventory/dispositions TASK-007/008; every listed predecessor is accepted and integrated into the recorded parent.
- **P-002:** Source pins, taskfmt `52d9f1eb7721f409bc47beb9fced7997b5c13ede`, reviewed tui-snap revision, image/toolchain/lock and immutable catalog/context identities resolve from protected receipts.
- **P-003:** The host froze exact owned scenario membership, source-qualified non-applicability, numeric traces and new-test obligations; the executor cannot choose expected output or expand write scope.

## Scope

In scope:

- `crates/tui/src/theme` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/ui/paint.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/tests/completion_011.rs` solely for the named task-specific regression and mutation witnesses.

Out of scope:

- Application domain repairs, unrelated component families, alternative runtime/editor/collection engines, baseline blessing, provider execution, branch promotion and publication.
- Changing accepted proof tools, protected adapters, historical archives, task packages, expected artifacts, fixture membership, stage dispositions or another task's source scope.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Implement the exact forty-two-role ASCII table, typed rule/scrollbar sets and ten-frame spinner sequence in ADJ-06; test every role independently of the conversion loop. Preserve default Junie/Paper tables, role discriminants, width-one nonempty bytes, idempotence, sticky border conversion and later explicit overrides. Preserve ADJ-05 limited reset groups and authored untouched syntax/meter tokens. All source-qualified historical clauses assigned to this task and listed in trusted/obligations.md are binding with their recorded accepted/superseded/deferred dispositions. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Use semantic PaintStyle provenance, not RGB role inference. State rules merge by specificity and declaration before subtree/instance/part/slot overrides. Keep Clear/Inherit/Set and modifier add/remove. Preserve all seventy-three slot projection histories and authored palette eligibility; narrow capability with existing meet, never public Ord. Preserve the architectural and CP-COMMON clauses in trusted/obligations.md, using the same production owner for pixels and interaction. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Actual-cell sentinels cross family/variant/custom neutral, focused versus hovered planes, disabled disjoint slots, aliases, nonzero dim layers, all four capabilities and both themes. Test all 4×4 meet pairs plus associativity and override order. Negative witnesses include dropped palette provenance, ignored exact-part slot, altered default glyph and silent full-token seed recascade. Execute every required historical/oracle test identity under the immutable stage map; compatible and previously closed cases stay green, all future-owned failures remain recorded and no case is silently omitted.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** Do not edit expected frames, oracle or comparison rules, accepted harness/adapter/test-disposition inputs, task protocols, required-set membership, capability/slot allowances or receipts. Do not duplicate generic widget engines, substitute test-only/inert painters, fabricate semantics, weaken checks, bless candidate output, or perform domain/provider operations.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The full host-controlled canonical gate passes on the frozen exact tree, with protected-input integrity, actual prerequisite ancestry and complete check evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Owned behavior matches exact oracle
```gherkin
Given the sealed theme-paint oracle cases and the exact task history clauses

```

- **Check:** `CHK-004`

### AC-002 — Architectural ownership holds
```gherkin
Given the live theme-paint implementation and independent ownership witnesses

```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-006`

### AC-003 — Complete regressions and negative cases hold
```gherkin
Given the frozen required test identities and the task-specific negative cases in R-003
When every required target and profile executes with complete outcome accounting
Then each positive and negative case has its required outcome and no closed case regresses
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-003`
- **Check:** `CHK-005`

### AC-004 — Verification authority stays immutable
```gherkin
Given the host-owned catalog source pins expected artifacts and accepted prerequisite receipts
When exact identity ancestry scope and trust boundaries are checked
Then no forbidden write or candidate-controlled acceptance input is admitted
```

When the real production update and draw paths run on the frozen candidate
Then all required frames cursors semantics and ordered checkpoints are captured without substitution
```

- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-007 — Complete executable PTY diagnostic evidence
```gherkin
Given the frozen full-application PTY diagnostic corpus and its immutable correction-owner stage map
When exact input bytes resize events and clocks drive the production binaries
Then every required checkpoint and actual outcome is recorded without treating future-owned application mismatches as component parity
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-007:** Apply the fixed re-audit contract in `trusted/obligations.md` as a binding refinement of R-001/R-002/R-003, with CHK-002/004 exact observations, CHK-005 positive/negative execution and CHK-006 ownership witnesses. It is not deferred design work.

- **D-001:** Use semantic PaintStyle provenance, not RGB role inference. State rules merge by specificity and declaration before subtree/instance/part/slot overrides. Keep Clear/Inherit/Set and modifier add/remove. Preserve all seventy-three slot projection histories and authored palette eligibility; narrow capability with existing meet, never public Ord.
- **D-002:** Apply ADJ-03, ADJ-05, ADJ-06 exactly as recorded in architecture-adjudication.md.
- **D-003:** TASK-073 establishes observation/registry infrastructure; TASK-031 proves complete repaired-family equality. Do not weaken inherited attribution or registry checks to accommodate an incomplete family.
- **D-004:** Missing or impossible required behavior is a failed obligation, not a skip. Any necessary change outside this narrow scope returns to its owning prerequisite and requires renewed acceptance.
- **D-005:** Future `/proof/bin/tc-proof` operations are installed only from accepted producer receipts: TASK-001 host/comparator core, TASK-070 preflight/required/oracle/capture/close, TASK-071 account-tests and TASK-072 architecture. No candidate-local substitute or recursive taskfmt gate is permitted.
- **D-006:** Oracle comparison CHK-004 covers this task's frozen component-owned direct fixtures and already closed required cases. Full production application PTY frames remain owned by their app correction/closure tasks; CHK-003 captures their complete diagnostic evidence and CHK-005 records every actual mismatch under the immutable stage map. Capture completeness is not parity. No app frame is cropped, masked, rewritten or treated as an empty passing set, and this task cannot depend on an unrepaired application's full-frame equality. Component-sensitive PTY lifecycle/behavior obligations use source-qualified applicability and their separately owned architecture/behavior probes; final app closure compares all complete PTY frames.

## Candidate observation ownership

R-001 and R-002 explicitly permit extraction-only observation seams in this task's already writable production source or completion-test files. They are untrusted candidate code, built with the frozen candidate and real production handlers/renderers; they are not accepted oracle adapters, judges, schema authors or receipt producers. TASK-002–006 own the protected observation schema and logical identity mapping; TASK-070 owns independently qualified source/binary/action binding and wrong-state, constant-state, omitted-field, wrong-source and test-only-substitution rejection. Candidate seams may serialize actual focus/edit/selection/target/overlay/domain state, but may not replace input dispatch/rendering, synthesize expected state, branch on a test-only product path or alter protected mappings. The existing prohibition on changing observation adapters means protected reference adapters and runner policy; it does not forbid these explicitly scoped untrusted extraction seams. A seam needing another task's source path remains outside scope and must be assigned before dispatch.

## Campaign execution binding

The explicit [campaign executor adaptation](/work/docs/refactoring-plan/campaign-executor-protocol.md) is mandatory. It preserves canonical AGENTS template provenance but supersedes its executor-authoritative checks and empty-progress invocation. Local checks are advisory; the executor submits candidate/progress to the operator, who invokes the existing host freeze and verify commands with immutable per-check contexts, pinned configuration, explicit base and complete progress. Only the host-authentic exact-tree verdict authorizes completion/integration. No new scheduler or taskfmt lifecycle API is implied.
