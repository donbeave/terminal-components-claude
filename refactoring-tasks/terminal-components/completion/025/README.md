# TASK-025 — Restore code editing readonly selection and diagnostics

## Goal

CodeEditor preserves readonly caret, editing, diagnostics and find trajectories.

## Context

This package describes future implementation, not work authorized by the current planning goal. UI authority is immutable oracle `02f5294bfdbf38004cc49130d0aff1d01f31434c`; architectural starting source is `7b27732a8c3c131760ec3438f641cb3c11343a42`. Existing source/tests establish preservation obligations, not oracle parity. Required predecessors: `TASK-016`, `TASK-024`, `TASK-021`, `TASK-008`, `TASK-073`. Receipt acceptance and integrated source ancestry are both mandatory.

Read before editing:

- `/task/trusted/source-witnesses.md` in full; its finite source-state, actual-paint and real-mutant cases are normative R-001/R-002/R-003 proof obligations, not optional examples.
- `/task/trusted/obligations.md` in full, including every assigned historical clause.
- `/task/trusted/source-obligations.tsv` in full; its exact source-qualified clauses, dispositions and task/check mappings are normative, not optional background.
- `/work/docs/refactoring-plan/components.md`, `architecture.md`, `architecture-adjudication.md` and `proof-contract.md`.
- Every pinned oracle/main source and existing test named in the trusted family/historical rows.

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The protected host has accepted TASK-001/070/071/072 products, sealed complete baseline TASK-006 and exact inventory/dispositions TASK-007/008; every listed predecessor is accepted and integrated into the recorded parent.
- **P-002:** Source pins, taskfmt `52d9f1eb7721f409bc47beb9fced7997b5c13ede`, reviewed tui-snap revision, image/toolchain/lock and immutable catalog/context identities resolve from protected receipts.
- **P-003:** The host froze exact owned scenario membership, source-qualified non-applicability, numeric traces and new-test obligations; the executor cannot choose expected output or expand write scope.

## Scope

In scope:

- `crates/tui/src/components/code.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/text/editor.rs` and `crates/tui/src/text/buffer.rs` solely for the shared multiline indentation action and non-public buffer support in D-INDENT-CORE; preserve TASK-013 grammar, normalization, secret-buffer safety and every existing consumer.
- `crates/tui/tests/completion_025.rs` solely for the named task-specific regression and mutation witnesses.

Out of scope:

- Application domain repairs, unrelated component families, alternative runtime/editor/collection engines, baseline blessing, provider execution, branch promotion and publication.
- Changing accepted proof tools, protected adapters, historical archives, task packages, expected artifacts, fixture membership, stage dispositions or another task's source scope.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Readonly pointer click moves caret and permits selection/copy without mutation. Editable completed click enters at exact pointer, keyboard focus alone does not. Integrate shared editor/output/completion primitives for highlight/diagnostics/gutter/current line, find query paste, selection and scrolling. All source-qualified historical clauses assigned to this task and listed in trusted/obligations.md are binding with their recorded accepted/superseded/deferred dispositions. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Keep borrowed Highlighter/Segmenter and update-owned revision caches; one text editor grammar and runtime cursor owner. No owned syntax clone, alternative test painter or app-specific editor engine. Preserve the architectural and CP-COMMON clauses in trusted/obligations.md, using the same production owner for pixels and interaction. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Probe readonly first/repeated click, press-only/release-outside, remapped edit/find/completion, tabs/CJK/combining spans, diagnostic changes, wrap/scroll resize and disabled field. Measure highlight cache revision/width invalidation; cells and copied original text agree with oracle. Execute every required historical/oracle test identity under the immutable stage map; compatible and previously closed cases stay green, all future-owned failures remain recorded and no case is silently omitted.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** Do not edit expected frames, oracle or comparison rules, accepted harness/adapter/test-disposition inputs, task protocols, required-set membership, capability/slot allowances or receipts. Do not duplicate generic widget engines, substitute test-only/inert painters, fabricate semantics, weaken checks, bless candidate output, or perform domain/provider operations.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The full host-controlled canonical gate passes on the frozen exact tree, with protected-input integrity, actual prerequisite ancestry and complete check evidence.

- **Check:** `CHK-003`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-INDENT-CORE:** TASK-025 also owns the narrowly scoped shared multiline indentation primitive in text/editor.rs and text/buffer.rs, after TASK-013/016. TextEditorCore::apply remains the sole public mutation entry point; CodeEditor chooses the existing Tab policy and invokes that primitive. Indent/dedent operates only on the source-selected inclusive line interval, preserves source cursor/anchor rebasing, removes up to the configured count of leading ASCII spaces, and does not clone/rewrite the whole document. Buffer-level insertion/removal support stays non-public outside the editing core. Preserve all existing EditAction behavior, single-line guards, sensitive-buffer zeroization and non-code consumer semantics; W-025-07 covers forward/reversed/multiline/boundary selections and no-selection controls.

- **D-BRANCH-SOURCE:** Freeze W-025-07/08 alongside existing source-mode and target-aware paste witnesses: range Tab/BackTab indentation, navigation versus editing movement, wheel persistence until cursor movement/resize, running/diagnostic precedence and narrow find-footer suffix/count. Reuse TextEditorCore commands and accepted viewport geometry, borrowed Highlighter/Segmenter and immutable draw; no alternate grammar or owned document clone. TASK-008 must source-dispose any exact starting test assertion that conflicts with these already oracle-owned modes while retaining compatible cache/runtime assertions. TASK-025 cannot edit protected test dispositions, preserve contradictory expected behavior, or redefine source outputs.

- **D-CONFIGURED-PASTE:** Provide one narrow public configured CodeEditor paste helper for explicitly source-authorized application forwarding; ordinary runtime Intent::Paste calls the same target-selection and mutation path. Disabled configuration rejects. Otherwise active find-query typing has priority and uses the shared single-line normalization/editor action even when the document is readonly or not editing, as oracle code.rs:609–631 and paste_and_backspace_edit_find_query_in_each_document_mode require; the document stays unchanged. Without an active find query, only editing and non-readonly document state invokes the shared TextEditorCore::apply paste action. Preserve exact response/effects, limits, match refresh and scroll/caret consequences. No hidden Intent, forged focus, duplicate insertion, bypassed configuration or app-selected internal target. Ordinary modal capture remains TASK-017's policy. Applications alone decide whether their pinned oracle branch forwards paste; the helper does not select deferred F01 or install global layer passthrough. TASK-016 owns the corresponding TextInput helper. Paired runtime/helper tests compare bytes, selection/caret, query/matches, response/effects and limit behavior for non-ASCII/multiline paste across every eligible document/query configuration; disabled and ineligible document-only controls remain unchanged.
- **D-001:** Keep borrowed Highlighter/Segmenter and update-owned revision caches; one text editor grammar and runtime cursor owner. No owned syntax clone, alternative test painter or app-specific editor engine.
- **D-002:** Preserve accepted current APIs; historical proposed or rejected alternatives in the trusted appendix are not new implementation authority.
- **D-003:** TASK-073 establishes observation/registry infrastructure; TASK-031 proves complete repaired-family equality. Do not weaken inherited attribution or registry checks to accommodate an incomplete family.
- **D-004:** Missing or impossible required behavior is a failed obligation, not a skip. Any necessary change outside this narrow scope returns to its owning prerequisite and requires renewed acceptance.
- **D-005:** Future `/proof/bin/tc-proof` operations are installed only from accepted producer receipts: TASK-001 host/comparator core, TASK-070 preflight/required/oracle/capture/close, TASK-071 account-tests and TASK-072 architecture. No candidate-local substitute or recursive taskfmt gate is permitted.
- **D-006:** Oracle comparison CHK-004 covers this task's frozen component-owned direct fixtures and already closed required cases. Full production application PTY frames remain owned by their app correction/closure tasks; CHK-003 captures their complete diagnostic evidence and CHK-005 records every actual mismatch under the immutable stage map. Capture completeness is not parity. No app frame is cropped, masked, rewritten or treated as an empty passing set, and this task cannot depend on an unrepaired application's full-frame equality. Component-sensitive PTY lifecycle/behavior obligations use source-qualified applicability and their separately owned architecture/behavior probes; final app closure compares all complete PTY frames.

## Candidate observation ownership

R-001 and R-002 explicitly permit extraction-only observation seams in this task's already writable production source or completion-test files. They are untrusted candidate code, built with the frozen candidate and real production handlers/renderers; they are not accepted oracle adapters, judges, schema authors or receipt producers. TASK-002–006 own the protected observation schema and logical identity mapping; TASK-070 owns independently qualified source/binary/action binding and wrong-state, constant-state, omitted-field, wrong-source and test-only-substitution rejection. Candidate seams may serialize actual focus/edit/selection/target/overlay/domain state, but may not replace input dispatch/rendering, synthesize expected state, branch on a test-only product path or alter protected mappings. The existing prohibition on changing observation adapters means protected reference adapters and runner policy; it does not forbid these explicitly scoped untrusted extraction seams. A seam needing another task's source path remains outside scope and must be assigned before dispatch.

## Campaign execution binding

The explicit [campaign executor adaptation](/work/docs/refactoring-plan/campaign-executor-protocol.md) is mandatory. It preserves canonical AGENTS template provenance but supersedes its executor-authoritative checks and empty-progress invocation. Local checks are advisory; the executor submits candidate/progress to the operator, who invokes the existing host freeze and verify commands with immutable per-check contexts, pinned configuration, explicit base and complete progress. Only the host-authentic exact-tree verdict authorizes completion/integration. No new scheduler or taskfmt lifecycle API is implied.
