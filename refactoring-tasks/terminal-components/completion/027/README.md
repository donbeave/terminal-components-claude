# TASK-027 — Restore reusable static chrome actions and empty states

## Goal

Reusable chrome preserves action geometry, borrowed facts and readiness paint.

## Context

This package describes future implementation, not work authorized by the current planning goal. UI authority is immutable oracle `02f5294bfdbf38004cc49130d0aff1d01f31434c`; architectural starting source is `7b27732a8c3c131760ec3438f641cb3c11343a42`. Existing source/tests establish preservation obligations, not oracle parity. Required predecessors: `TASK-011`, `TASK-012`, `TASK-010`, `TASK-014`, `TASK-015`, `TASK-020`, `TASK-022`, `TASK-024`, `TASK-008`, `TASK-073`. Receipt acceptance and integrated source ancestry are both mandatory.

Read before editing:

- `/task/trusted/source-witnesses.md` in full; its finite source-state, actual-paint and real-mutant cases are normative R-001/R-002/R-003 proof obligations, not optional examples.
- `/task/trusted/obligations.md` in full, including every assigned historical clause.
- `/task/trusted/source-obligations.tsv` in full; its exact source-qualified clauses, dispositions and task/check mappings are normative, not optional background.
- `/work/docs/refactoring-plan/components.md`, `architecture.md`, `architecture-adjudication.md` and `proof-contract.md`.
- Every pinned oracle/main source and existing test named in the trusted family/historical rows.

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The protected host has accepted TASK-001/070/071/072 products, sealed complete baseline TASK-006 and exact inventory/dispositions TASK-007/008; every listed predecessor is accepted and integrated into the recorded parent.
- **P-002:** Source pins, taskfmt `52d9f1eb7721f409bc47beb9fced7997b5c13ede`, reviewed tui-snap revision, image/toolchain/lock and immutable catalog/context identities resolve from protected receipts.
- **P-003:** The host froze exact owned scenario membership, source-qualified non-applicability, numeric traces and new-test obligations; the executor cannot choose expected output or expand write scope.

## Scope

In scope:

- `crates/tui/src/components/button.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/brand.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/panel.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/props.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/empty.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/collection/empty.rs` solely for the shared EmptyState title/help/icon geometry, owner-style inheritance, actual resolution provenance and readiness paint required here; TASK-015's row-author contract remains unchanged.
- `crates/tui/src/components/too_small.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/tests/completion_027.rs` solely for the named task-specific regression and mutation witnesses.

Out of scope:

- Application domain repairs, unrelated component families, alternative runtime/editor/collection engines, baseline blessing, provider execution, branch promotion and publication.
- Changing accepted proof tools, protected adapters, historical archives, task packages, expected artifacts, fixture membership, stage dispositions or another task's source scope.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Button exact keyboard/completed-click and disabled/readiness geometry; Brand static lockup versus click-only branch; Panel title/meta/badge/container-focus clipped body; borrowed Props/PropsList rich wrapping/copy/secret masks; EmptyState inherited owner styles and exact clipped, wrapped, vertically centered source Empty/Error block; TooSmall four-line notice and recovery match oracle. All source-qualified historical clauses assigned to this task and listed in trusted/obligations.md are binding with their recorded accepted/superseded/deferred dispositions. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-002 (MUST):** No second focus stop for decorative containers, no public secret copy, no obsolete Lockup/ScrollPanel clone. EmptyState already has inheritance: preserve rather than duplicate it. All static/action chrome uses semantic public components and source text belongs to caller. Preserve the architectural and CP-COMMON clauses in trusted/obligations.md, using the same production owner for pixels and interaction. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Test each five collection owners Empty/Loading/Partial/Error with actual-cell sentinels, ignored ICON slot negative, panel empty callback once, Props keyed copy/reorder/secret lock, late position labels and too-small minimum−1/equal/+1. Both themes/all capabilities plus nonzero/zero clips; changing live source facts changes painted cells. Execute every required historical/oracle test identity under the immutable stage map; compatible and previously closed cases stay green, all future-owned failures remain recorded and no case is silently omitted.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** Do not edit expected frames, oracle or comparison rules, accepted harness/adapter/test-disposition inputs, task protocols, required-set membership, capability/slot allowances or receipts. Do not duplicate generic widget engines, substitute test-only/inert painters, fabricate semantics, weaken checks, bless candidate output, or perform domain/provider operations.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The full host-controlled canonical gate passes on the frozen exact tree, with protected-input integrity, actual prerequisite ancestry and complete check evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Owned behavior matches exact oracle
```gherkin
Given the sealed button and brand and panel and props and empty-readiness and too-small oracle cases and the exact task history clauses

Then every required cell cursor action and semantic observation matches its authoritative contract
```

**Verification**

- **Check:** `CHK-004`

### AC-002 — Architectural ownership holds
```gherkin
Given the live button and brand and panel and props and empty-readiness and too-small implementation and independent ownership witnesses

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-BRANCH-SOURCE:** Restore oracle EmptyState geometry through the already scoped shared Empty helper and standalone component: intersect the allocation with the buffer, wrap the optional hint at max(width.saturating_sub(4),8), vertically center the complete title plus optional blank row plus wrapped hint block using saturating subtraction, truncate and horizontally center each line within the clipped width, and clip bottom rows. Error renders the centered '! '+title in error tone with only '!' bold; ordinary title is muted and hint faint against the caller background. W-027-07 proves these source-backed Empty/Error configurations; it does not invent Loading/Partial oracle behavior. Preserve existing modern readiness and per-state TITLE/HELP/ICON reachability, inherited owner/provenance and real paint sinks. Layout measurement and painting must consume one shared geometry result, not disagreeing wrap estimates or an app-local renderer.

- **D-EMPTY-OWNER:** Shared EmptyState production painting belongs to `collection/empty.rs`; standalone Empty belongs to `components/empty.rs`. Keep one shared readiness layout policy. TASK-015 completes first because its collection scope overlaps this file. TASK-020/022/024 also complete first so the mandatory five-owner readiness proof uses accepted family forwarding. This task repairs the shared painter; a forwarding defect returns to its named family prerequisite. TASK-031 repeats the complete five-owner closure without omissions or weakened expected cells.

- **D-001:** No second focus stop for decorative containers, no public secret copy, no obsolete Lockup/ScrollPanel clone. EmptyState already has inheritance: preserve rather than duplicate it. All static/action chrome uses semantic public components and source text belongs to caller.
- **D-002:** Preserve accepted current APIs; historical proposed or rejected alternatives in the trusted appendix are not new implementation authority.
- **D-003:** TASK-073 establishes observation/registry infrastructure; TASK-031 proves complete repaired-family equality. Do not weaken inherited attribution or registry checks to accommodate an incomplete family.
- **D-004:** Missing or impossible required behavior is a failed obligation, not a skip. Any necessary change outside this narrow scope returns to its owning prerequisite and requires renewed acceptance.
- **D-005:** Future `/proof/bin/tc-proof` operations are installed only from accepted producer receipts: TASK-001 host/comparator core, TASK-070 preflight/required/oracle/capture/close, TASK-071 account-tests and TASK-072 architecture. No candidate-local substitute or recursive taskfmt gate is permitted.
- **D-006:** Oracle comparison CHK-004 covers this task's frozen component-owned direct fixtures and already closed required cases. Full production application PTY frames remain owned by their app correction/closure tasks; CHK-003 captures their complete diagnostic evidence and CHK-005 records every actual mismatch under the immutable stage map. Capture completeness is not parity. No app frame is cropped, masked, rewritten or treated as an empty passing set, and this task cannot depend on an unrepaired application's full-frame equality. Component-sensitive PTY lifecycle/behavior obligations use source-qualified applicability and their separately owned architecture/behavior probes; final app closure compares all complete PTY frames.

## Candidate observation ownership

R-001 and R-002 explicitly permit extraction-only observation seams in this task's already writable production source or completion-test files. They are untrusted candidate code, built with the frozen candidate and real production handlers/renderers; they are not accepted oracle adapters, judges, schema authors or receipt producers. TASK-002–006 own the protected observation schema and logical identity mapping; TASK-070 owns independently qualified source/binary/action binding and wrong-state, constant-state, omitted-field, wrong-source and test-only-substitution rejection. Candidate seams may serialize actual focus/edit/selection/target/overlay/domain state, but may not replace input dispatch/rendering, synthesize expected state, branch on a test-only product path or alter protected mappings. The existing prohibition on changing observation adapters means protected reference adapters and runner policy; it does not forbid these explicitly scoped untrusted extraction seams. A seam needing another task's source path remains outside scope and must be assigned before dispatch.

## Campaign execution binding

The explicit [campaign executor adaptation](/work/docs/refactoring-plan/campaign-executor-protocol.md) is mandatory. It preserves canonical AGENTS template provenance but supersedes its executor-authoritative checks and empty-progress invocation. Local checks are advisory; the executor submits candidate/progress to the operator, who invokes the existing host freeze and verify commands with immutable per-check contexts, pinned configuration, explicit base and complete progress. Only the host-authentic exact-tree verdict authorizes completion/integration. No new scheduler or taskfmt lifecycle API is implied.
