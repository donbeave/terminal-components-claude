# TASK-024 — Restore picker chains filters and completion ownership

## Goal

Pickers preserve borrowed query identity, chained stages and editor completion ownership.

## Context

This package describes future implementation, not work authorized by the current planning goal. UI authority is immutable oracle `02f5294bfdbf38004cc49130d0aff1d01f31434c`; architectural starting source is `7b27732a8c3c131760ec3438f641cb3c11343a42`. Existing source/tests establish preservation obligations, not oracle parity. Required predecessors: `TASK-020`, `TASK-023`, `TASK-016`, `TASK-008`, `TASK-073`. Receipt acceptance and integrated source ancestry are both mandatory.

Read before editing:

- `/task/trusted/source-witnesses.md` in full; its finite source-state, actual-paint and real-mutant cases are normative R-001/R-002/R-003 proof obligations, not optional examples.
- `/task/trusted/obligations.md` in full, including every assigned historical clause.
- `/task/trusted/source-obligations.tsv` in full; its exact source-qualified clauses, dispositions and task/check mappings are normative, not optional background.
- `/work/docs/refactoring-plan/components.md`, `architecture.md`, `architecture-adjudication.md` and `proof-contract.md`.
- Every pinned oracle/main source and existing test named in the trusted family/historical rows.

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The protected host has accepted TASK-001/070/071/072 products, sealed complete baseline TASK-006 and exact inventory/dispositions TASK-007/008; every listed predecessor is accepted and integrated into the recorded parent.
- **P-002:** Source pins, taskfmt `52d9f1eb7721f409bc47beb9fced7997b5c13ede`, reviewed tui-snap revision, image/toolchain/lock and immutable catalog/context identities resolve from protected receipts.
- **P-003:** The host froze exact owned scenario membership, source-qualified non-applicability, numeric traces and new-test obligations; the executor cannot choose expected output or expand write scope.

## Scope

In scope:

- `crates/tui/src/components/filter_list.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/picker.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/picker_chain.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/src/components/completion.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `apps/showcase/src/pages/pickers.rs` solely to add a compile-only exhaustive no-op `PickerAction::Submit` match arm at pinned-main lines1037–1066; keep query submission disabled and every existing action/result/detail/level/layer branch unchanged. No Showcase behavior restoration or scenario changes here.
- `crates/tui/tests/completion_024.rs` solely for the named task-specific regression and mutation witnesses.

Out of scope:

- Application domain repairs, unrelated component families, alternative runtime/editor/collection engines, baseline blessing, provider execution, branch promotion and publication.
- Changing accepted proof tools, protected adapters, historical archives, task packages, expected artifacts, fixture membership, stage dispositions or another task's source scope.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** FilterList/Picker consume semantic AsItem independently of RowFn; filter/paste/grapheme queries preserve source indexes. CommandPalette unavailable/destructive actions retain exact stable target. PickerChain back/error/retry retains stage query and breadcrumb; Completion uses insert text or label fallback, exact editor splice and independent label/detail width maxima. Opt-in typed keyless query submission follows W-024-08 without fabricated item identity. All source-qualified historical clauses assigned to this task and listed in trusted/obligations.md are binding with their recorded accepted/superseded/deferred dispositions. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Caller owns stages/data/jobs; component owns reusable projection/navigation only. CompletionController routes Arrow/Tab/Enter/Esc/remap/paste between editor and popup; runtime layers own placement/capture. No fake semantic selection or renderer-defined identity. Preserve the architectural and CP-COMMON clauses in trusted/obligations.md, using the same production owner for pixels and interaction. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Test non-Clone/non-Display borrowed sources, empty/loading/partial/error, nonsearchable rows, unavailable action, target reorder before release, stage back/retry and narrowing resize. Match original-grapheme indexes, exact inserted bytes, popup fade/caret and editor unchanged on canceled completion. Execute every required historical/oracle test identity under the immutable stage map; compatible and previously closed cases stay green, all future-owned failures remain recorded and no case is silently omitted.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** Do not edit expected frames, oracle or comparison rules, accepted harness/adapter/test-disposition inputs, task protocols, required-set membership, capability/slot allowances or receipts. Do not duplicate generic widget engines, substitute test-only/inert painters, fabricate semantics, weaken checks, bless candidate output, or perform domain/provider operations.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The full host-controlled canonical gate passes on the frozen exact tree, with protected-input integrity, actual prerequisite ancestry and complete check evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Owned behavior matches exact oracle
```gherkin
Given the sealed filter-list and picker-command-palette and picker-chain and completion oracle cases and the exact task history clauses

Then every required cell cursor action and semantic observation matches its authoritative contract
```

**Verification**

### AC-002 — Architectural ownership holds
```gherkin
Given the live filter-list and picker-command-palette and picker-chain and completion implementation and independent ownership witnesses

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-003`
- **Check:** `CHK-005`

### AC-004 — Verification authority stays immutable

- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-BRANCH-SOURCE:** Completion must measure separate maximum semantic label and detail display widths, not the maximum combined width of any single row. The source presentation requests clamp(max_label+max_detail+8,24,48) before runtime placement/clipping and uses source-qualified detail visibility, first-frame and resize geometry; W-024-07 binds unequal-row maxima and popup lifecycle. Picker/FilterList add a shared typed keyless Submit outcome under an explicit query-submission capability, disabled by default to preserve existing generic callers. With that capability enabled, a source-searchable, nonblank query and no eligible current item produces Submit through the same normal/alternate Enter command path; an eligible item keeps its keyed normal/alternate outcome. Submit carries no fabricated key/index; the caller reads its own query state. Keep ordinary disabled and hidden-query guards, and encode separately the actual oracle readiness/eligibility fallback cases in W-024-08 rather than silently adopting deferred F01. TASK-042 enables the capability for Files jump and consumes Submit as selected=None. No application raw-Enter handler, fake item, second filter/editor or domain work in the component. Capability-off retains existing generic Ready/Loading/Error/Partial behavior. Modern Partial remains consumed with no action for both capability states; no source PickerStatus::Partial exists, so enabling source Submit does not extend that state. TASK-024 may change apps/showcase/src/pages/pickers.rs only to add the exhaustive no-op Submit match arm required by the additive PickerAction variant; leave the capability off, result/detail/level/layer state and every existing product branch unchanged. This compile-only consumer repair does not close or alter Showcase app parity.

- **D-001:** Caller owns stages/data/jobs; component owns reusable projection/navigation only. CompletionController routes Arrow/Tab/Enter/Esc/remap/paste between editor and popup; runtime layers own placement/capture. No fake semantic selection or renderer-defined identity.
- **D-002:** Preserve accepted current APIs; historical proposed or rejected alternatives in the trusted appendix are not new implementation authority.
- **D-003:** TASK-073 establishes observation/registry infrastructure; TASK-031 proves complete repaired-family equality. Do not weaken inherited attribution or registry checks to accommodate an incomplete family.
- **D-004:** Missing or impossible required behavior is a failed obligation, not a skip. Any necessary change outside this narrow scope returns to its owning prerequisite and requires renewed acceptance.
- **D-005:** Future `/proof/bin/tc-proof` operations are installed only from accepted producer receipts: TASK-001 host/comparator core, TASK-070 preflight/required/oracle/capture/close, TASK-071 account-tests and TASK-072 architecture. No candidate-local substitute or recursive taskfmt gate is permitted.
- **D-006:** Oracle comparison CHK-004 covers this task's frozen component-owned direct fixtures and already closed required cases. Full production application PTY frames remain owned by their app correction/closure tasks; CHK-003 captures their complete diagnostic evidence and CHK-005 records every actual mismatch under the immutable stage map. Capture completeness is not parity. No app frame is cropped, masked, rewritten or treated as an empty passing set, and this task cannot depend on an unrepaired application's full-frame equality. Component-sensitive PTY lifecycle/behavior obligations use source-qualified applicability and their separately owned architecture/behavior probes; final app closure compares all complete PTY frames.

## Candidate observation ownership

R-001 and R-002 explicitly permit extraction-only observation seams in this task's already writable production source or completion-test files. They are untrusted candidate code, built with the frozen candidate and real production handlers/renderers; they are not accepted oracle adapters, judges, schema authors or receipt producers. TASK-002–006 own the protected observation schema and logical identity mapping; TASK-070 owns independently qualified source/binary/action binding and wrong-state, constant-state, omitted-field, wrong-source and test-only-substitution rejection. Candidate seams may serialize actual focus/edit/selection/target/overlay/domain state, but may not replace input dispatch/rendering, synthesize expected state, branch on a test-only product path or alter protected mappings. The existing prohibition on changing observation adapters means protected reference adapters and runner policy; it does not forbid these explicitly scoped untrusted extraction seams. A seam needing another task's source path remains outside scope and must be assigned before dispatch.

## Campaign execution binding

The explicit [campaign executor adaptation](/work/docs/refactoring-plan/campaign-executor-protocol.md) is mandatory. It preserves canonical AGENTS template provenance but supersedes its executor-authoritative checks and empty-progress invocation. Local checks are advisory; the executor submits candidate/progress to the operator, who invokes the existing host freeze and verify commands with immutable per-check contexts, pinned configuration, explicit base and complete progress. Only the host-authentic exact-tree verdict authorizes completion/integration. No new scheduler or taskfmt lifecycle API is implied.
