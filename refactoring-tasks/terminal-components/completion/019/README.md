# TASK-019 — Complete all declared Form invariants

## Goal

Form satisfies all thirteen declared invariants with live per-phase data.

## Context

This package describes future implementation, not work authorized by the current planning goal. UI authority is immutable oracle `02f5294bfdbf38004cc49130d0aff1d01f31434c`; architectural starting source is `7b27732a8c3c131760ec3438f641cb3c11343a42`. Existing source/tests establish preservation obligations, not oracle parity. Required predecessors: `TASK-018`, `TASK-008`, `TASK-073`. Receipt acceptance and integrated source ancestry are both mandatory.

Read before editing:

- `/task/trusted/obligations.md` in full, including every assigned historical clause.
- `/task/trusted/source-witnesses.md` in full; its finite case IDs, source anchors, inputs, axes and exact checkpoints are mandatory host-frozen proof inputs, not executor-selected examples.
- `/task/trusted/source-obligations.tsv` in full; its exact source-qualified clauses, dispositions and task/check mappings are normative, not optional background.
- `/work/docs/refactoring-plan/components.md`, `architecture.md`, `architecture-adjudication.md` and `proof-contract.md`.
- Every pinned oracle/main source and existing test named in the trusted family/historical rows.

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The protected host has accepted TASK-001/070/071/072 products, sealed complete baseline TASK-006 and exact inventory/dispositions TASK-007/008; every listed predecessor is accepted and integrated into the recorded parent.
- **P-002:** Source pins, taskfmt `52d9f1eb7721f409bc47beb9fced7997b5c13ede`, reviewed tui-snap revision, image/toolchain/lock and immutable catalog/context identities resolve from protected receipts.
- **P-003:** The host froze exact owned scenario membership, source-qualified non-applicability, numeric traces and new-test obligations; the executor cannot choose expected output or expand write scope.

## Scope

In scope:

- `crates/tui/src/components/choice.rs` only for the private configured Form radio bridge accepting the navigation-commit policy and consuming the shared typed navigation result; no second key/reconcile path.

- `crates/tui/src/components/form.rs` solely for the behavior and direct proof stated in this package.
- `crates/tui/tests/completion_019.rs` solely for the named task-specific regression and mutation witnesses.

Out of scope:

- Application domain repairs, unrelated component families, alternative runtime/editor/collection engines, baseline blessing, provider execution, branch promotion and publication.
- Changing accepted proof tools, protected adapters, historical archives, task packages, expected artifacts, fixture membership, stage dispositions or another task's source scope.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Prove F1–F13 from history-inline-obligations.tsv individually: configuration-only props; declaration-order traversal; hidden geometry absence with eligible draft retention; pure height/reveal; ID-only actions; draw purity/FocusOut commit; first action plus all invalidation; nested Select Esc; layer-agnostic body; commit-visible-validation-cross-validation-submit order; editing blocks accidental Enter submit; dirty on commit; secret redaction/clearing. All source-qualified historical clauses assigned to this task and listed in trusted/obligations.md are binding with their recorded accepted/superseded/deferred dispositions. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve per-phase semantic items, private configured bridges and closed FieldKind. FormData::disabled occurs before one mutable value_and_options borrow; inherited OR configured disable applies. No dyn/public item-aware trait, public secret projection, owned values bundle or domain execution. Preserve the architectural and CP-COMMON clauses in trusted/obligations.md, using the same production owner for pixels and interaction. Apply every corresponding row in `trusted/source-obligations.tsv` according to its exact source-qualified disposition and assigned acceptance/check mapping; accepted clauses require implementation or preservation proof, and rejected/superseded/deferred alternatives require their stated non-goal or replacement proof.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Test all kinds, sections/pairs, hidden/removal/type/sensitivity transitions, reordered stable IDs, server errors and first failing field reveal/focus. Under ADJ-12 validate every visible field exactly once in declaration order, retain each field error through the existing sensitivity-safe path, skip hidden validators, run cross-validation only after all visible fields pass, and focus/reveal only the first invalid field after the complete scan. Commit the active edit once before clearing stale errors and validation; preserve cancel draft cleanup and immediate choice dirty. Same Form works bare/Panel/Dialog. Execute every required historical/oracle test identity under the immutable stage map; compatible and previously closed cases stay green, all future-owned failures remain recorded and no case is silently omitted.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** Do not edit expected frames, oracle or comparison rules, accepted harness/adapter/test-disposition inputs, task protocols, required-set membership, capability/slot allowances or receipts. Do not duplicate generic widget engines, substitute test-only/inert painters, fabricate semantics, weaken checks, bless candidate output, or perform domain/provider operations.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The full host-controlled canonical gate passes on the frozen exact tree, with protected-input integrity, actual prerequisite ancestry and complete check evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Owned behavior matches exact oracle
```gherkin
Given the sealed form oracle cases and the exact task history clauses
When the production behaviors and boundary states in R-001 are compared
Then every required cell cursor action and semantic observation matches its authoritative contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

### AC-002 — Architectural ownership holds
```gherkin
Given the live form implementation and independent ownership witnesses
When the R-002 borrowed state routing styling and production-path boundaries are exercised
Then each boundary holds and every specified violating witness is rejected
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-006`

### AC-003 — Complete regressions and negative cases hold
```gherkin
Given the frozen required test identities and the task-specific negative cases in R-003
When every required target and profile executes with complete outcome accounting
Then each positive and negative case has its required outcome and no closed case regresses
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-003`
- **Check:** `CHK-005`

### AC-004 — Verification authority stays immutable
```gherkin
Given the host-owned catalog source pins expected artifacts and accepted prerequisite receipts
When exact identity ancestry scope and trust boundaries are checked
Then no forbidden write or candidate-controlled acceptance input is admitted
```

When the real production update and draw paths run on the frozen candidate
Then all required frames cursors semantics and ordered checkpoints are captured without substitution
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-007 — Complete executable PTY diagnostic evidence
```gherkin
Given the frozen full-application PTY diagnostic corpus and its immutable correction-owner stage map
When exact input bytes resize events and clocks drive the production binaries
Then every required checkpoint and actual outcome is recorded without treating future-owned application mismatches as component parity
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-009:** ADJ-15 configured Select policies reuse existing Chose and the private Form bridge; no second engine, new Form switch or Select action. Exact changed/clamped callbacks, open-only Tab precedence and generic-default preservation are required in trusted finite witnesses.

- **D-007:** Apply ADJ-10 and the fixed re-audit contract in `trusted/obligations.md` as a binding refinement of R-001/R-002/R-003, with CHK-002/004 exact observations, CHK-005 positive/negative execution and CHK-006 ownership witnesses. It is not deferred design work.

- **D-001:** Preserve per-phase semantic items, private configured bridges and closed FieldKind. FormData::disabled occurs before one mutable value_and_options borrow; inherited OR configured disable applies. No dyn/public item-aware trait, public secret projection, owned values bundle or domain execution.
- **D-002:** Apply ADJ-08 exactly as recorded in architecture-adjudication.md.
- **D-003:** TASK-073 establishes observation/registry infrastructure; TASK-031 proves complete repaired-family equality. Do not weaken inherited attribution or registry checks to accommodate an incomplete family.
- **D-004:** Missing or impossible required behavior is a failed obligation, not a skip. Any necessary change outside this narrow scope returns to its owning prerequisite and requires renewed acceptance.
- **D-005:** Future `/proof/bin/tc-proof` operations are installed only from accepted producer receipts: TASK-001 host/comparator core, TASK-070 preflight/required/oracle/capture/close, TASK-071 account-tests and TASK-072 architecture. No candidate-local substitute or recursive taskfmt gate is permitted.
- **D-006:** Oracle comparison CHK-004 covers this task's frozen component-owned direct fixtures and already closed required cases. Full production application PTY frames remain owned by their app correction/closure tasks; CHK-003 captures their complete diagnostic evidence and CHK-005 records every actual mismatch under the immutable stage map. Capture completeness is not parity. No app frame is cropped, masked, rewritten or treated as an empty passing set, and this task cannot depend on an unrepaired application's full-frame equality. Component-sensitive PTY lifecycle/behavior obligations use source-qualified applicability and their separately owned architecture/behavior probes; final app closure compares all complete PTY frames.

## Candidate observation ownership

R-001 and R-002 explicitly permit extraction-only observation seams in this task's already writable production source or completion-test files. They are untrusted candidate code, built with the frozen candidate and real production handlers/renderers; they are not accepted oracle adapters, judges, schema authors or receipt producers. TASK-002–006 own the protected observation schema and logical identity mapping; TASK-070 owns independently qualified source/binary/action binding and wrong-state, constant-state, omitted-field, wrong-source and test-only-substitution rejection. Candidate seams may serialize actual focus/edit/selection/target/overlay/domain state, but may not replace input dispatch/rendering, synthesize expected state, branch on a test-only product path or alter protected mappings. The existing prohibition on changing observation adapters means protected reference adapters and runner policy; it does not forbid these explicitly scoped untrusted extraction seams. A seam needing another task's source path remains outside scope and must be assigned before dispatch.

## Campaign execution binding

The explicit [campaign executor adaptation](/work/docs/refactoring-plan/campaign-executor-protocol.md) is mandatory. It preserves canonical AGENTS template provenance but supersedes its executor-authoritative checks and empty-progress invocation. Local checks are advisory; the executor submits candidate/progress to the operator, who invokes the existing host freeze and verify commands with immutable per-check contexts, pinned configuration, explicit base and complete progress. Only the host-authentic exact-tree verdict authorizes completion/integration. No new scheduler or taskfmt lifecycle API is implied.
