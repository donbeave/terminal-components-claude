# TASK-006 — Implement keyed collections and reconciliation

## Goal

Collection components share keyed selection, navigation, filtering, tabs, tree expansion, and reconciliation semantics, with bounded consumer adoption across reference applications.

## Context

Lists and navigation surfaces must preserve semantic identity across source reorder/removal while keeping distinct visual recipes. Implement List, FilterList, NavList, Tree, Tabs, Steps, and their collection foundations, and execute the P2 bounded consumer-adoption checkpoint across `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla`.

Dependencies: TASK-004. Canonical contracts: [components/README.md](../../../docs/components/README.md), [components/list.md](../../../docs/components/list.md), [components/filter-list.md](../../../docs/components/filter-list.md), [components/nav-list.md](../../../docs/components/nav-list.md), [components/tree.md](../../../docs/components/tree.md), [components/tabs.md](../../../docs/components/tabs.md), [components/steps.md](../../../docs/components/steps.md), [foundations/collections.md](../../../docs/foundations/collections.md), [design/interaction-contract.md](../../../docs/design/interaction-contract.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-implementation`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- Keyed collections, filtering, navigation, tree expansion, tabs/steps, selection reconciliation, and scroll handoff.
- Bounded consumer-adoption checkpoint: integrate candidate collection and navigation components into affected presentation call sites across `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla`.

Out of scope:

- Unkeyed index-only selection, component-local collection engines, product data providers, and new application flows.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Bounded consumer-adoption call sites in `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla` adopt candidate collections while keeping application domain models, simulations, scenarios, snapshots, and observable visual/interaction outputs 1:1 invariant.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — A collection preserves the selected stable key and emits typed navigation actions through the shared runtime.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — Reordering, removal, empty results, disabled rows, and boundary navigation follow the canonical state matrix.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references, application invariants, and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the immutable visual-baseline applications and bounded consumer-adoption call sites
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then only allowed component-adoption call sites change; application behavior, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations are unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-004 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** Stable semantic item keys own selection and reconciliation; source order is input, not durable identity; candidate components are integrated incrementally into consumer applications rather than deferred.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-implementation`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is enforced by narrow writable library/conformance paths and forbidden application/oracle paths.
