# TASK-011 — Unify panel, split, scroll, and text viewport infrastructure

## Goal

Panel, SplitPane, ScrollRegion, and TextViewport share one geometry, clipping, scrollbar, thumb-capture, and fade policy, with bounded consumer adoption across reference applications.

## Context

Scrolling and viewport behavior must be reusable across output and overlays. Panel plus TextViewport replaces a separate ScrollPanel mechanism while preserving each documented visual recipe. Execute the P5 bounded consumer-adoption checkpoint across `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla`.

Dependencies: TASK-004, TASK-006. Canonical contracts: [components/README.md](../../../docs/components/README.md), [components/panel.md](../../../docs/components/panel.md), [components/split-pane.md](../../../docs/components/split-pane.md), [components/scroll-region.md](../../../docs/components/scroll-region.md), [components/text-viewport.md](../../../docs/components/text-viewport.md), [architecture/overview.md](../../../docs/architecture/overview.md), [foundations/layout.md](../../../docs/foundations/layout.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-implementation`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- Panel, SplitPane, ScrollRegion, TextViewport, measurement, clipping, scrollbar/thumb capture, fades, and resize handling.
- Bounded consumer-adoption checkpoint: integrate candidate layout, split, scroll, and viewport infrastructure into affected presentation call sites across `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla`.

Out of scope:

- A separate ScrollPanel engine, app-specific scrolling, output model ownership, and restyling.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Bounded consumer-adoption call sites in `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla` adopt candidate viewports and layout infrastructure while keeping application domain models, simulations, scenarios, snapshots, and observable visual/interaction outputs 1:1 invariant.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — A viewport measures, clips, scrolls, and draws with deterministic geometry and shared capture behavior.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — Top/middle/bottom scroll, thumb drag, fade timing, resize, empty content, and minimum geometry remain contract-compliant.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references, application invariants, and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the immutable visual-baseline applications and bounded consumer-adoption call sites
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then only allowed component-adoption call sites change; application behavior, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations are unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-004 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** One ScrollRegion mechanism owns scrolling, thumb capture, and shared fade policy; Panel and TextViewport compose it; candidate components are integrated incrementally into consumer applications rather than deferred.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-implementation`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is enforced by narrow writable library/conformance paths and forbidden application/oracle paths.
