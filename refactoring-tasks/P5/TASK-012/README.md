# TASK-012 — Implement Grid, CodeEditor, and DiffView rich output

## Goal

Grid, CodeEditor, and DiffView share keyed measurement, text editing, and viewport foundations while preserving their distinct rendering and interaction contracts.

## Context

Grid has one engine with table-row and cell/grid modes. CodeEditor extends the shared text core; DiffView projects review content and selection. Their contracts define visual parts and state matrices.

Dependencies: TASK-007, TASK-011. Canonical contracts: [components/README.md](../../../docs/components/README.md), [components/grid.md](../../../docs/components/grid.md), [components/code-editor.md](../../../docs/components/code-editor.md), [components/diff-view.md](../../../docs/components/diff-view.md), [foundations/text.md](../../../docs/foundations/text.md), [foundations/collections.md](../../../docs/foundations/collections.md), [design/visual-contract.md](../../../docs/design/visual-contract.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-refactor`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- Unified Grid engine, table-row/cell modes, CodeEditor editing/diagnostics, DiffView projection/selection, and viewport composition.

Out of scope:

- Database backends, query engines, repository operations, product editors, and separate table implementations.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** The frozen applications, snapshots, and visual-baseline tests remain untouched; their exact output is the oracle.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Rich output measures, draws, and emits typed actions through stable row/column/item keys.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — Wide cells, continuation, read-only selection, diagnostics, source reorder/removal, empty/error/partial states, and narrow widths preserve the contract.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the immutable visual-baseline applications and protected paths
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then application source, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations are unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-004 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** Grid remains one engine with two modes; CodeEditor uses the shared text core; DiffView remains a presentation component.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-refactor`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is enforced by narrow writable library/conformance paths and forbidden application/oracle paths.
