# TASK-003 — Build shared runtime focus, capture, time, and layers

## Goal

Runtime-owned focus, hit testing, pointer capture, press timing, and layer placement serve every component through one shared mechanism.

## Context

Focus, hover, capture, press feedback, modal stacking, restoration, and time must not be reimplemented by widgets. Implement the ownership described by the runtime and layer foundations after TASK-002.

Dependencies: TASK-001, TASK-002. Canonical contracts: [architecture/overview.md](../../../docs/architecture/overview.md), [foundations/runtime.md](../../../docs/foundations/runtime.md), [foundations/layers.md](../../../docs/foundations/layers.md), [foundations/input-actions.md](../../../docs/foundations/input-actions.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-refactor`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- Runtime event routing, focus ownership, hit regions, pointer capture, activation timing, layer stack, and focus restoration.

Out of scope:

- Component-specific event loops, product session services, terminal emulation, and application redesign.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** The frozen applications, snapshots, and visual-baseline tests remain untouched; their exact output is the oracle.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Pointer and keyboard traces route to the same focused component with capture and release outcomes matching the contract.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — Nested overlays restore prior focus and reject outside activation according to the shared layer policy.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the immutable visual-baseline applications and protected paths
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then application source, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations are unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-004 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** The runtime owns focus, hit, capture, time, and layers; components report semantic intent through typed responses.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-refactor`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is enforced by narrow writable library/conformance paths and forbidden application/oracle paths.
