# TASK-015 — Migrate preserved consumers and prove composed conformance

## Goal

The four preserved applications adopt the refactored reusable components through narrow call-site changes while retaining their frozen observable behavior.

## Context

The applications are reference consumers and integration fixtures, not product targets. This is the only package with application source scope. Its verifier enumerates exact existing presentation files that call reusable TUI APIs; it does not grant an entire application directory. The files may change only where needed to adopt the public Termrock components and caller-owned state. Scenarios, product behavior, source data, and outputs remain unchanged.

Dependencies: TASK-008, TASK-010, TASK-014. Canonical contracts: [in-place migration](../../../docs/implementation/migration.md), [applications/README.md](../../../docs/applications/README.md), [applications/showcase.md](../../../docs/applications/showcase.md), [applications/tablepro.md](../../../docs/applications/tablepro.md), [applications/jackin-preview.md](../../../docs/applications/jackin-preview.md), [applications/holla.md](../../../docs/applications/holla.md), [verification/conformance.md](../../../docs/verification/conformance.md), [verification/visual-parity.md](../../../docs/verification/visual-parity.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-refactor`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- The exact application presentation call-site files listed in `verify.toml`: Showcase app/page composition; TablePro app, connection, tab, and workbench composition; Jackin Preview app/screen composition; Holla app/screen composition; library-level composition probes; preserved application conformance traces; and integration evidence against the immutable oracle.
- Generic additions under `tests/termrock/` and `tests/conformance/` needed to exercise these compositions.
- The exact `src/bin/tablepro/model.rs` path is writable only for the `preview_sql` adapter and its directly related fixture/interface update in `preview_sql_orders_updates_inserts_deletes`, if the new caller-owned Grid model requires that fixture change. Preserve the test's existing behavioral assertions.

Out of scope:

- Any shared library implementation path (`src/lib.rs`, `src/core/`, `src/runtime.rs`, `src/theme.rs`, `src/ui/`, or `src/widgets/`); implementation gaps return to their owning component/foundation task.
- Every application file absent from the exact `verify.toml` allowlist, including app entrypoints/CLI scenario selection, app tests, Showcase data, Jackin/Holla domains, simulators, scenarios, clocks, and art helpers. In `model.rs`, everything outside the narrowly allowed `preview_sql` adapter and its directly related fixture remains out of scope: `sql_literal`, history, completion, switcher, database, query execution, and SQL generation or preview semantics.
- New routes, services, providers, databases, Docker, authorization, Git operations, product redesign, fixture/data changes, and application behavior changes.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** Application edits are limited to the exact existing presentation files enumerated in `verify.toml` and the specific `preview_sql` adapter exception in R-006. App entrypoints, unrelated app tests, fixture/data/domain/simulation/scenario files, database/SQL modules, snapshots, and visual-baseline tests remain unchanged. The four applications retain their scenarios, observable interaction, and rendered output.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.
- **R-006 (MUST):** Adapt only `preview_sql`'s data boundary so it consumes TablePro's caller-owned Termrock Grid rows and pending-edit state. Preserve the full ordered SQL output byte-for-byte for equivalent table, column, original-row, and edit inputs, including dirty-row and changed-column order, original-key predicates, NULL/DEFAULT behavior, no-op revert behavior, composite primary keys, and the no-primary-key fallback. Preserve SQL literal formatting and escaping. The existing inline preview regression assertions must remain and may change only as needed to construct the new input fixture. `sql_literal`, query SQL/execution, Safe Mode policy, history, completion, switcher, database fixtures, and all other application-model behavior stay unchanged. An independent diff review must confirm that `model.rs` changes are limited to `preview_sql` and its directly related fixture construction.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Composed library scenarios match expected focus, capture, selection, navigation, state, and rendering outcomes for all four applications.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — Nested overlays, resize, narrow geometry, motion phases, source reconciliation, and cross-component event routing preserve parity.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the exact presentation-file allowlist and immutable visual-baseline outputs
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then only component-adoption call sites and the R-006 preview input adapter changed; application behavior, rendered output, scenarios, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations remain unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

### AC-004 — TablePro preview adapter matches the sealed baseline vectors
```gherkin
Given the sealed TablePro SQL preview ExistingOracle vectors from TASK-001
When the caller-owned Grid model contains the same base rows and pending edits
Then preview_sql returns the same complete ordered SQL strings and the existing preview interaction retains its frozen output
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-006`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-005 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-005`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** Applications remain reference consumers; the exact file allowlist permits reusable-library call sites and typed component-action wiring, plus only the TablePro preview input adapter in R-006. It excludes app entrypoints, unrelated app tests, application models, fixtures, domains, simulators, scenarios, and product/backend modules.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-refactor`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is the enumerated presentation files, the exact `model.rs` file for R-006 only, and generic library/conformance tests; no whole application directory or library implementation path is writable. Task-format grants file-level scope; R-006 defines the required source-range boundary.
- **D-004:** The SQL preview oracle test compares full strings and covers update/insert/delete order, changed-column ordering, original/composite keys, NULL and DEFAULT handling, `DEFAULT VALUES`, no-primary-key fallback, no-op reverts, integer/two-decimal/boolean/text/JSON literals and escaping, and keyed reorder/filter/removal so pending edits cannot retarget another row.
