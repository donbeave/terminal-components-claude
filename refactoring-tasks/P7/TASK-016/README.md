# TASK-016 — Close the public API and architecture audit

## Goal

The implementation satisfies the canonical Termrock API and architecture ownership rules without legacy future-facing surface leaks.

## Context

After composition, audit all public exports and shared ownership. Legacy source names may remain temporarily as internals, but future documentation and exports must describe Termrock's constrained API.

Dependencies: TASK-015. Canonical contracts: [api/public-api.md](../../../docs/api/public-api.md), [api/types.md](../../../docs/api/types.md), [api/authoring.md](../../../docs/api/authoring.md), [architecture/overview.md](../../../docs/architecture/overview.md), [implementation/plan.md](../../../docs/implementation/plan.md), [verification/conformance.md](../../../docs/verification/conformance.md).

## Preconditions

- **P-001:** The caller has supplied a committed descendant of annotated `visual-baseline` (`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`) on `termrock-refactor`.
- **P-002:** The linked canonical architecture, API, component, design, and verification documents are present.
- **P-003:** The future implementation environment provides `rtk` and `cargo nextest`.

## Scope

In scope:

- Public export audit, ownership audit, legacy surface quarantine, duplicate mechanism removal, and architecture conformance tests.

Out of scope:

- Repository/package rename, source rename outside the implementation plan, compatibility guarantees for legacy APIs, and application changes.

## Requirements

- **R-001 (MUST):** Deliver the scoped mechanism according to the linked canonical contracts.
- **R-002 (MUST):** Preserve caller-owned state, borrowed props, typed actions, stable identities, and shared foundation ownership required by the API.
- **R-003 (MUST):** The frozen applications, snapshots, and visual-baseline tests remain untouched; their exact output is the oracle.
- **R-004 (MUST NOT):** No product implementation, service integration, repository migration, or application redesign is added to this library task.
- **R-005 (MUST):** The completion gate succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Public exports and implementation ownership match the canonical API, foundations, and component documents.
```gherkin
Given the linked canonical contracts and the accepted dependency work
When the scoped Termrock mechanism is exercised
Then its update, measure, draw, and typed-action behavior matches the contract
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-001`
- **Check:** `CHK-001`

### AC-002 — No universal boxed Widget, show-only API, duplicate engine, candidate-controlled oracle, or component-local runtime ownership remains.
```gherkin
Given an applicable boundary, interaction, or reconciliation state
When the future implementation is exercised
Then the documented state, identity, geometry, and ownership invariants hold
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** scenario
- **Covers:** `R-002`
- **Check:** `CHK-002`

### AC-003 — Frozen references and scope remain protected
```gherkin
Given the immutable visual-baseline applications and protected paths
When the candidate tree is checked after implementation
Then application source, snapshots, baseline tests, and product integrations are unchanged
```

**Verification**

- **Type:** invariant
- **Covers:** `R-003, R-004`
- **Check:** `CHK-003`

### AC-004 — Completion gate passes

**Verification**

- **Type:** gate
- **Check:** `CHK-004`

## Fixed decisions

- **D-001:** The repository becomes Termrock in place over time; this task closes the target API without claiming all source identifiers are already renamed.
- **D-002:** The work stays in this repository on `termrock-refactor`; it never creates a separate implementation repository.
- **D-003:** The package's verifier scope is enforced by narrow writable library/conformance paths and forbidden application/oracle paths.
