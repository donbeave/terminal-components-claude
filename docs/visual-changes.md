# Visual changes ledger

**What this is.** The ledger `COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §20.10 requires and `xtask bless-guard` (§16.3) reads. No baseline file (`crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt`, `apps/*/tests/baselines/*.txt`, `perf_baseline.txt` hit counts) may be regenerated without an entry here that names a numbered §20.10 item, **accounts for every baseline key the diff moved or added**, and names the reviewable artefact — a capture path under `shots/` for a baseline produced by a running application, **or** the frame-text dump for a baseline produced headlessly by a `Scene`, named explicitly (§16.3 as amended by §36). Every entry classifies a difference as *intended* (matches the §20.10 item), *fix* (a demonstrated defect in the old output) or *regression* (must be fixed, never blessed).

**Order, fixed (review A14, §21 item 30): change → capture → classify → bless.**

1. **Change** — land the code change on the working tree.
2. **Capture** — for an application baseline, `tools/capture.sh` / `xtask capture-matrix` writes the before/after captures into `shots/`. For a headless `Scene` matrix there is no capture and there can be none (`tools/capture.sh` drives a terminal session and cannot address a `Scene`, §36): the artefact is the frame text the failing run prints. Digest tests go red either way.
3. **Classify** — add or extend the entry under the matching §20.10 item below: the reviewable artefact, the affected tests/baseline lines, the moved and added keys, and the classification with its reason.
4. **Bless** — `BLESS=1 cargo test --workspace --test render --test render_components --test visual` (or `PERF_BLESS=1` for hit counts). `xtask bless-guard` is specified in §16.3 and **is implemented and binding** (`xtask/src/main.rs`, the `bless-guard` subcommand over the `baseline_moves_are_classified` check). It fails closed: with no base revision — neither `BLESS_GUARD_BASE` nor `GITHUB_BASE_REF` — it refuses rather than comparing against `HEAD`, because comparing against `HEAD` passes vacuously (commit `f28a81e`). This ledger is therefore machine-enforced, not convention enforced by review. <!-- corrected 2026-09-05: the previous text claimed the guard was unimplemented. It has been implemented since §47; that sentence was stale, and it is the only claim replaced here. -->

A capture cannot exist before the change, so `bless-guard` never runs locally against an unchanged tree. No baseline is regenerated because a test failed; the classification comes first.

**Entry format** (one per affected surface). Every field of an entry lives inside **one** fenced block, so a reader that strips fences loses neither the classification, nor the citation, nor the evidence:

```

- surface:   <app>/<page or component>/<state> @ <w>x<h> / <theme> / <color level>
- captures:  shots/<before>.png  →  shots/<after>.png
             — for a headless `Scene` matrix instead: `none under shots/`, the reason,
               and the named frame-text dump that replaces it
- tests:     <baseline file>:<line or name>, <test names>
- moved:     <key> <old hash> → <new hash>, one line per baseline key whose hash
             changed; `none` when nothing moved
- added:     <key>, one line per baseline key recorded for the first time; a key
             *pattern* with its exact count is admissible when one matrix generates
             the whole set; `none` when nothing was added
- class:     intended | fix | regression
- reason:    <one sentence tying it to the numbered §20.10 item>
```

**`- moved:` is read, never predicted.** The moved set cannot be known before it is generated, so this field is produced by `git diff <baseline file>` **after a scratch bless that is then discarded** (§36.3): bless into the working tree, read the diff, `git checkout --` the baseline to throw the scratch bless away, write this field from what the diff said, then bless again and commit. The discarded bless is an instrument for reading the diff; the committed bless follows the classification, so the fixed order is not violated.

**`- moved:` and `- added:` partition the diff.** A key that has a previous hash is *moved*; a key recorded for the first time is *added*. Every key the diff touches appears in exactly one of the two fields — that equality, not co-presence of an entry, is what §36.5 makes the checkable property.

**`- captures:` admits two artefacts, and only two.** A capture path under `shots/` for a baseline produced by a running application; or, for a baseline produced headlessly by a `Scene`, the statement that no capture exists or can exist plus the **name** of the frame-text dump that stands in for it — the `Mismatch` / `Missing` branch output of `Scene::assert_against`, which prints the frame text in both cases. §36 established that `tools/capture.sh` drives a terminal session and cannot address a `Scene` at all, so requiring a `shots/` path universally would make the component matrix unblessable by its own rule.

## Item 1 — Mono legibility fallbacks (§11.4, §21 item 25)

### 1a — `Tabs` paints §11.4's mono `PRESSED` bracket

**§20.10 classification line:** at `ColorLevel::Mono` every state gains a symbol or
modifier — for `PRESSED`, explicit reverse + `BOLD` + `PressLeft`/`PressRight`
brackets (§21 item 25).

**What changed.** §11.4's `PRESSED` row already mandated the `[label]` bracket and
never said **who paints it**. `Button::draw` consults the `LABEL` glyph slot and
painted it; the `Tabs` row fn paints its label through `RowUi`, which cannot consult
that slot, so a tab never got the bracket. `Tabs` now paints it into the pad cells
the tab already reserves — geometry is identical. Without it a pressed tab and a
focused tab are the same picture under `Mono`: the mono `PRESSED` and `FOCUSED`
styles differ only in colour, and at `Mono` there is no colour.

```
- surface:   tui-next/tabs/pressed @ {120x40, 40x10} / {junie, paper} / mono
             (truecolor cells are untouched: the bracket branch is gated on
             `Slot::Set(GlyphRole::PressLeft)`, and that slot is set only by a rule
             appended at `ColorLevel::Mono`)
- captures:  none under `shots/` — this is a headless digest matrix, not a running
             app: `tools/capture.sh` drives a terminal session and cannot address a
             `Scene`. The reviewable artefact is the frame text the failing
             `Scene::assert_against` printed for each moved cell, alongside the
             digest diff of `crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt` in the same
             commit; the painted **text** gains the two bracket glyphs in cells the
             tab already reserved as padding, and nothing else moves.
- tests:     crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt (mono lines only),
             render::components::tabs::pressed,
             conformance::tabs::mono_states_are_distinguishable
- moved:     4 lines, every one `mono` (`git diff crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt`):
  render::components::tabs::pressed 120 40 junie mono 5517de00b23ac747 → 8531aef99ed82a7c

  render::components::tabs::pressed 40 10 paper mono dfaa198c140af319 → 35b0ee5d62f85452
- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 1 (mono legibility fallbacks). §11.4 already prescribed the
             `PRESSED` bracket; `Tabs` did not paint it, so under `Mono` a pressed
             tab was byte-identical to a focused one — a declared rule that produced
             no output, which is a demonstrated defect in the old picture rather than
             a downgrade of it.
```

### 1b — `field::disabled` clears the required marker in mono (§29 `Slot<GlyphRole>` migration)

**What changed.** The `Slot<GlyphRole>` migration makes `Slot::Clear` distinct from
`Slot::Inherit`. The mono `DISABLED` rules for `GUTTER` and `MARKER` use
`Slot::Clear`, so the required field's reserved marker cell is now filled rather
than inheriting the `*`. The no-BLESS frame text showed `Name` with no required
marker, which is the declared mono fallback executing rather than an accidental
restyle. This is a second movement of the same keys recorded in item 18a, so it is
classified independently under item 1.

```
- surface:   tui-next/field/disabled @ {120x40, 40x10} / {junie, paper} / mono
- captures:  none under `shots/` — this is a headless `Scene` matrix. The reviewable
             artefact is the frame-text dump printed by the no-BLESS
             `render::components::field::disabled` run; its first moved frame shows
             the required marker cell cleared. `tools/capture.sh` cannot address a
             `Scene`, and no separate capture file is in this task's ownership.
- tests:     crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt (mono lines only),
             render::components::field::disabled
- historical-moved: 4 keys, every one `mono` (superseded by stabilized reconciliation below):
  render::components::field::disabled 120 40 junie mono 399b0a5bc31c9d66 → a17a3ce53b0c07c0

  render::components::field::disabled 40 10 paper mono 55505cb874284414 → 4356d66d70ef949a
- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 1 (mono legibility fallbacks). The `Slot::Clear` rule now
             executes for the required marker's reserved cell, removing an inert
             fallback and making the disabled field's mono output match its declared
             glyph semantics.
```

### 1c — Select retains the mono pressed field bracket

```

### 1d — Loading has its own mono ICON modifier

```
- surface:   every `Caps::REPORTS_STATUS` component at `ColorLevel::Mono` under `LOADING`
- captures:  none; no retained eight-state digest key isolates `LOADING`
- tests:     theme::mono_parts_exactly_cover_every_reserved_rule_part,
             conformance::<reports-status-component>::mono_states_are_distinguishable
- moved:     none measured or authorized
- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 1. `BUSY` and `LOADING` paint the same animated ICON sequence. The
             20th generic mono fallback adds `UNDERLINED` to `Part::ICON + LOADING`, giving the
             data-loading state a capability-local signal without borrowing an unrelated fixture
             or runtime bit and without changing geometry. Any future digest movement requires
             fresh scratch capture and exact classification before bless.
```
- surface:   tui-next/select/pressed @ {120x40, 40x10} / {junie, paper} / mono
- captures:  none under `shots/`; clean Junie 120×40 before/after frame text is

             and `/tmp/fable-slice4-final-BPvDuo/repo/artifacts/frames/moved-after/mono/select--pressed.txt`.

- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 1. The corrected closed Select keeps the prescribed mono
             FIELD inverse+BOLD and GUTTER `[` / MARKER `]` bracket anatomy; the
             dedicated disclosure role no longer competes for the pressed marker cell.

## Item 15 — Focus-ring composition changes in migrated screens (§21 item 33)

Per affected test: old reachable count, new reachable count, the `Harness::ring().reachable()` listing, and the reason — written **before** the expected value in the test is edited. Also the home for `frame_showcase_lists_120x40`'s classified hit-count growth (§16.6, P8).

Any string containing U+FF9E/U+FF9F measures one column wider per mark, so every cell whose line moves is enumerated with the string that re-measured.

captures / classification: `(pending — filled when the change lands)`

## Item 17 — `Anchor::Point` flips instead of covering the pointer (§26, Adjudication N1)

**Already recorded as owed.** §26 risk 6 states that the flip is a visual change for
any existing tooltip or context menu near a screen edge, and that an entry under this
item is required **before any baseline that moves is blessed**. No tooltip or
context-menu baseline may be blessed until this section carries a real entry.

captures / classification: `(pending — filled when the change lands)`

## Item 18 — Mono `DISABLED` gains `DIM` on `FIELD`/`TEXT` and stops tinting the foreground into the background (§28, Adjudication P6)

### 18a — the mono `DISABLED` rules

**§20.10 classification line:** mono `DISABLED` gains `DIM` on `FIELD`/`TEXT` and
stops tinting the foreground into the background.

**What changed.** §11.4's `DISABLED` row prescribed `fg = Role::Fg(Faint)`. At
`ColorLevel::Mono` that is a defect, not a downgrade: `mono()` maps every step
below `Y = 0.35` to `Black`, and `junie`'s `disabled_fg` (`#4d4d4d`), `Fg(Faint)`
(`#262626`) and `surfaces[0]` (`#000000`) are all below it — a disabled control
was painted **black on black**, unreadable rather than merely colourless
(goal §29 asks for readable). The mono table also reached no part a *text*
control paints for its own content, so a disabled `TextInput` was
indistinguishable from an enabled one under `Mono` at all.

Three rule changes in `crates/tui/src/theme/downgrade.rs::mono_rules()`
(`MONO_RULES_PER_FAMILY` 16 → 18):

- new `(Part::FIELD, DISABLED)` and `(Part::TEXT, DISABLED)`:
  `set_fg(Fg(Primary)).remove(Modifier::all()).add(Modifier::DIM)`;
- amended `(Part::LABEL, DISABLED)` and `(Part::MARKER, DISABLED)`:
  `Fg(Faint)` → `Fg(Primary)`, same reason.

`Part::PLACEHOLDER` needs no rule (it inherits the `FIELD` fill's modifiers per cell)
and `Part::CONTAINER` needs none (a text control fills `FIELD`). The new rules are
declared **before** the `ERROR` rules, so `ERROR`'s `UNDERLINED` is not erased
by `remove(Modifier::all())`.

The four historical `field::disabled` keys are not repeated in this entry's
machine-checked movement field: item 1b owns their current second movement, and
the previous transition remains historical git evidence.

- captures:  none under `shots/` — this matrix is a headless digest matrix, not a
             running app: `tools/capture.sh` drives a terminal session and cannot

             `Scene::assert_against` printed for each moved cell, alongside the digest
             diff of `crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt` in the same commit;
             the painted **text** is byte-identical in every moved cell (the panic
             output shows it), so the whole difference is style.

             `Mono` (black on black) and gave a text control's disabled state no
             signal at all; the new output is `DIM` over the primary foreground,
             which §16.2 case 9 can see and a reader can read.
             `conformance::text_input::mono_states_are_distinguishable` now keeps
             `DISABLED` instead of narrowing it away (MA-8).
```

### 18b — `Button`'s mono `PRESSED` bracket moves out of the text run (§29 Q1), and `Dialog`'s action row moves with it

**What changes.** Under §29 Q1 `Button` stops painting the `PressLeft`/`PressRight`
bracket **inside** its text run and paints it into the cells the button reserves
around the label. The old in-run bracket consumed two columns of the label's own
run, so a label that exactly filled the button was **truncated** by the very glyphs
that were supposed to make it legible under `Mono` — a demonstrated defect in the
old output, not a restyle, which is why the class below is `fix` and not `intended`.

`Dialog` moves in the same pass and for the same reason: it does not draw its own
action buttons, it draws `Button` through `inherit_forced`, so every `Dialog` state
that paints an action row inherits the new bracket placement. §20.10 item 18's tail
clause, as extended by §36, names exactly this pair — `render::components::button::pressed`'s
mono line **together with the same state of every component that draws a `Button`
through `inherit_forced`, `Dialog`'s action row in the current matrix**.

             bracket in the reserved padding rather than inside the label run.

- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 18, tail clause as extended by §36. The old in-run bracket
             truncated a label that filled the button, so the old output is
             demonstrably wrong rather than merely different; `Dialog` moves because
             it draws its buttons through `inherit_forced` and has no bracket of its
             own.

## Item 19 — First-generation `render::components::*` digests for the Slice-4 component matrix (§36)

**First generation only.** Nothing moves: the component did not exist in the reviewed
tree, so no cell has a before-image and no cell is a difference from anything. The
second time one of these keys changes it classifies under items 1–18 or it is a
regression, and **this item may not be cited again for the same key**.

### 19a — the fourteen Slice-4 components record their first digest lines

**What is recorded.** Fourteen components — `text_area`, `select`, `radio_group`,
`checkbox`, `toggle`, `chip_bar`, `status_bar`, `hint_bar`, `key_hint`,
`progress_bar`, `spinner`, `meter`, `empty`, `brand` — each generate
8 states (`default`, `focused`, `hovered`, `pressed`, `disabled`, `selected`,
`editing`, `empty`) × {junie, paper} × {truecolor, mono} × {120×40, 40×10} = **64**
lines, **896** in total. One matrix (`crates/tui/tests/render_components.rs::run`)
generates the whole set from one loop nest, which is why the `- added:` field below
is a key pattern with an exact count rather than 896 transcribed keys.

**What this entry is not.** It is not an approval of how these components look. A
first-generation digest cannot be reviewed as a digest: the hash is not inspectable
and there is no before-image to diff. What is reviewed is the **frame**, and only its
glyph half; the style half — `fg`, `bg`, `modifier` — is reviewed by nobody here and
is asserted instead by the 20-case conformance matrix and the `theme::*` contrast and
mono-legibility tests. A first-generation line is a **pin against future drift, not
an approval of present appearance** (§20.10 item 19, §36.4); the first review of
these components *as pictures* is the Slice-5 capture matrix.

```
- surface:   tui-next/{text_area,select,radio_group,checkbox,toggle,chip_bar,
             status_bar,hint_bar,key_hint,progress_bar,spinner,meter,empty,brand}

             @ {120x40, 40x10} / {junie, paper} / {truecolor, mono}
- captures:  none under `shots/`, and none can exist — the matrix is headless:
             `Scene` draws into a `TestBackend` buffer and `tools/capture.sh` drives a
             terminal session, so it cannot address a `Scene` at all (§36.4).
             The artefact that replaces it is the **frame-text dump** printed by the
             `Missing` branch of `Scene::assert_against` during the no-BLESS
             `render_components` run. It is reviewable test output; no separate
             frame file is added because this task owns the ledger and baseline,
             not `docs/frames/`. §20.10 item 19 still treats these lines as pins
             against future drift, not approval of present appearance.
- tests:     crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt,
             render::components::{text_area,select,radio_group,checkbox,toggle,

             brand}::{default,focused,hovered,pressed,disabled,selected,editing,empty}
- moved:     none. No key in this entry has a previous hash; the components did not
             exist in the reviewed tree, so no cell has a before-image.
- added:     896 keys, the complete cross product of the machine-expandable pattern
             `render::components::{text_area,select,radio_group,checkbox,toggle,chip_bar,status_bar,hint_bar,key_hint,progress_bar,spinner,meter,empty,brand}::{default,focused,hovered,pressed,disabled,selected,editing,empty} {120 40,40 10} {junie,paper} {truecolor,mono}`.
             It expands to fourteen components × eight states × two sizes × two
             themes × two colour levels = 896 keys, 64 per component.
- class:     intended
- reason:    §20.10 item 19 (first-generation `render::components::*` digests for the
             Slice-4 component matrix). §16.3 requires one digest line per component
             × state × theme × colour × size and these fourteen had none; the lines
             are a pin against future drift, **not** an approval of present
             appearance, and the item may never be cited again for the same key.
```

## Item 20 — Forced state preserves the props-derived readiness state (§49)

### 20a — disabled readiness reporters paint their error affordance

**§20.10 classification line:** forcing `DISABLED` substitutes for the runtime state only;
the props-derived `ERROR` state remains present, so readiness-reporting components paint their
declared error affordance in truecolor and mono.

**What changed.** `render::components::{hint_bar,meter,progress_bar}::disabled` supplies
`Status::Error` while forcing `DISABLED`. Before §39's two-half state operator, the forced state
erased the props-derived `ERROR` bit, leaving each component's declared error recipe inert. The
corrected operator combines forced runtime state with props-derived state. A discarded scratch
bless measured exactly 22 moved keys: 8 HintBar, 6 Meter and 8 ProgressBar; 12 truecolor and 10
mono. No key was added.

**Independent visual review: PASS.** A fresh read-only visual analyst who did not generate the
lines reviewed the six corrected `junie` 120×40 frames (three components × truecolor and mono).
Each frame contains the declared `GlyphRole::Error` (`!`); the supplied labels, tracks and `65%`
remain intact; no error affordance appears in a ready-state cell; movement is confined to the
disabled baseline keys. Review criteria were §20.10 item 20's five rejection conditions: reject
if the error affordance is absent, appears for `Status::Ready`, changes a label, changes track
arithmetic or the percentage column beyond the affordance and its reserved columns, or occupies
no `GlyphSet` slot. **Review limit:** the evidence has no textual before-frame dumps, so exclusion
of unrelated changes relies on the exact 22-key digest scope plus the six reviewed after-frames;
the style half remains machine-asserted rather than visually recoverable from frame text.

             @ {120x40, 40x10} / {junie, paper} / {truecolor, mono}
- captures:  none under `shots/`; the matrix is headless. The earlier scratch capture at
             `/tmp/fable-slice4-final-BPvDuo/repo/artifacts/frames/new-components-clean/`
             is retained as historical evidence only: item 31 changed the reference mechanism,

             before-image; fresh independent frame review and an authorized serial
             bless remain pending. Item 27 owns these first-generation keys; item 31
             may account only for measured corrections to their generated frames.

             with the accepted picker borrowed-domain allocation obligation. This
             first numeric record changes no rendered cells.

- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 28 (state-owned semantic selection). A forced state is
             only a visual probe; List/Tabs state, RadioGroup controlled value and
             Select value exclusively own semantic selection. Review checks one
             marker/active tab, Radio one chosen plus exact press with no second,
             Select Ada/one chosen/brackets only pressed/no geometry or content
             drift, and containment. Machine proof is the forced-selection unit
             coverage plus complete conformance.
```

The Item-28 block above is retained as the historical, rejected pre-reconciliation scratch record;
it is not current blessing evidence. §20.10 now limits item 28 to its accepted 16-key authority,
and item 31 requires a fresh scratch measurement before any of those proposed movements is
classified or blessed.

## Item 29 — Select owns vertical disclosure glyphs

```
- surface:   tui-next Select closed/open field disclosure, all themes and color levels
- captures:  none under `shots/`; exact headless unit evidence is
             `select::select_disclosure_is_exact_for_both_themes_and_color_levels`
- tests:     no retained baseline line changes; the eight-state component matrix draws Select
             closed. Focused Select and builtin-glyph unit tests cover the live open state.
- moved:     none
- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 29. The old open Select reused the generic collapsed-tree glyph `▸`,
             pointing sideways instead of communicating an open dropdown. Dedicated
             `SelectClosed`/`SelectOpen` roles render `▾`/`▴`. The change affects all color levels,
             preserves the right-minus-two marker cell and popup geometry, and requires no
             retained eight-state baseline movement because those fixtures are closed.
```

## Item 30 — Dialog targets one owned control

```
- surface:   tui-next/dialog reference states, all retained theme/colour/size cells
- captures:  pending fresh discarded-scratch before/after frame text; no current capture is
             accepted for blessing
- tests:     dialog::a_reference_dialog_registers_no_control,
             dialog::reference_dialog_targets_one_owned_control_without_broadcasting,
             render::components::dialog::*
- moved:     see the stabilized item-30 entry below: exactly 28 keys
- added:     none
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 30. A no-prompt Dialog targets only its first enabled action for
             runtime reference states; prompt focus/editing targets only the input. Root chrome
             and siblings never inherit the target state. Exact movement must be captured and
             classified before any retained baseline is changed.
```

Item 30 owns the Dialog correction, not Dialog's already-retained first-generation baseline.
No item-30 bless has run or is authorized by this entry.

## Item 31 — Central exact-target reference scope

```
- surface:   every component reference fixture migrated from component-local forced propagation
             to outer Ui::reference exact-target or inert-None scope
- captures:  pending fresh discarded-scratch baseline diff and clean frame-text dumps after the
             source tree stabilizes; historical scratch bundles are not blessing evidence
- tests:     architecture::legacy_forced_state_apis_are_absent,
             architecture::reference_rendering_is_ui_scoped, complete conformance suite,
             render::components::*
- moved:     see the stabilized item-31 entry below: exactly 177 keys
- added:     item 27 retains sole ownership of its 576 first-generation Slice-4F keys; item 31
             authorizes no unmeasured addition
- class:     fix
- reason:    §20.10 item 31 removes the broadcast/live-leak defect class. The scope makes the
             entire subtree inert while only one declared component/item/part receives runtime
             reference bits. Semantic state stays caller-owned. Accept only exact-target or
             suppression corrections; reject live/default/semantic, geometry/content, multiple-
             target, registration and unaccounted changes.
```

No retained component or performance baseline has been regenerated or blessed for items 27, 30
or 31. The required order remains change → fresh scratch capture → exact classification →
independent review → separately authorized serial bless.
 
## Stabilized scratch reconciliation — 280 moved / 1,280 added
 
The authoritative comparison is `components.before.txt` SHA-256
`1ab8e9205a19069ff5f9d97d675df77e6051c6195ad7a882766163cc2e744c9e` to the

## Review status — Slice 4 component matrix, independent visual review (2026-09-05)

**Result: FAIL. No bless was performed, and none is authorized.**

- **Scope reviewed.** The **640** review frames for the Slice-4 component matrix, at HEAD
  `26913cc`, by a fresh read-only `opus-analyst` reviewer who did not generate the baselines.
- **Result.** **FAIL.** This supersedes the earlier **PASS** recorded against HEAD `a1759b2` in
  `REFACTORING_STATE.md`. That PASS line is retained there unedited as historical evidence; where
  the two conflict, this record governs.
- **Baseline effect: none.** `crates/tui/tests/baselines/components.txt` is **unchanged** by this
  review. No `BLESS=1` or `PERF_BLESS=1` run was made, no key moved, and no key was added. The
  entries above — items 1, 20, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31 and the stabilized scratch reconciliation — are
  unaffected and are **not** re-classified by this record.
- **Consequence.** Items 27, 30, 31 and every other Slice-4 first-generation item remain
  **unblessed**. §72's closing sentence stands verbatim: independent frame review and separate
  bless authorization remain required, and no retained baseline change is authorized.
- **Findings.** The itemised FAIL findings are owned by the review itself and are **not yet
  attached to this ledger**. They must be attached here, each mapped to a numbered §20.10 item and
  classified *intended* / *fix* / *regression*, **before** any bless run. A bless executed while
  this section reads FAIL with no attached findings is a violation of the fixed order
  change → capture → classify → bless, not an exception to it.
