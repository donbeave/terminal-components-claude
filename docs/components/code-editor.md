# CodeEditor

**Component ID:** W29 · **Phase:** P5 · **Legacy family:** C37
**Oracle:** `4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`

This page owns the Termrock CodeEditor contract. It targets the in-place
refactor of the frozen editor; it does not authorize a source rename or a
language-service implementation during the documentation phase.

## Purpose and boundary

CodeEditor presents a borrowed document with a shared text editing core,
gutter, line numbers, syntax spans, diagnostics, find state, completion, and a
scrolling viewport. The caller supplies the document, source revision,
highlighter/segmenter callbacks, diagnostics, and completion provider.

The component owns caret/selection, draft editing state, find query and current
match, viewport positions, and completion controller state. Languages, parsing,
language servers, file I/O, persistence, diagnostics computation, and completion
data remain external.

CodeEditor shares the text core with TextInput and TextArea and shares the
projection/scroll machinery with TextViewport. It must not embed a second
grapheme editor, scroll model, or display mapping.

The related canonical contracts are [`TextInput`](./text-input.md),
[`TextArea`](./text-area.md), [`TextViewport`](./text-viewport.md), and
[`Completion`](./completion.md).

### Non-goals

- syntax parsing, language-server transport, file watching, or save policy;
- changing a caller document from `draw` or from read-only input;
- a hidden global text buffer or source-file store;
- a universal widget trait or legacy `WidgetId`/`Outcome`/`RenderCtx` API;
- treating diagnostics or completion as decoration that can alter source
  coordinates.

## Frozen evidence and provenance

Evidence is pinned to the baseline commit `4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`.

- Source: `src/widgets/code.rs` (blob
  `3c653fc1e7f76563b92ff702abeec00fd3574bbb`) and completion behavior in
  `src/widgets/completion.rs` (blob
  `89c9e468c89dfc91c1afa69e11fefe951bcddade`).
- Inline tests cover scrollbar endpoints, read-only navigation, edit
  commit/cancel, find grapheme offsets, multiline paste, document replacement,
  manual scroll, horizontal cursor visibility, tab behavior, resize, and
  narrow/nonzero-origin clipping.
- Visual consumer: Showcase CodeEditor page and its protected snapshots under
  `snapshots/showcase/pages/codeeditor`; interaction evidence remains in
  `tests/visual_baseline`.

and [`../api/public-api.md`](../api/public-api.md).

## Target public API

```rust
CodeEditor::new(id: Id, document: &'a dyn TextSource) -> CodeEditor<'a>

update(
    &self,
    cx: &mut Cx<'_>,
    state: &mut CodeEditorState,
) -> Response<CodeAction>

draw(
    &self,
    ui: &mut Ui<'_>,
    area: Rect,
    state: &CodeEditorState,
) -> Rect

measure(
    &self,
    cx: &MeasureCx<'_>,
    constraints: Constraints,
) -> Size
```

Builders:

```rust
read_only(bool)
highlighter(&'a Highlighter)
segmenter(&'a Segmenter)
diagnostics(&'a [Diagnostic])
tab_behavior(TabBehavior)
line_numbers(bool)
patch(StylePatch)
```

The target action family is:

```rust
CodeAction::Edited
CodeAction::Commit { text: String }
CodeAction::Cancelled
CodeAction::SelectionChanged
CodeAction::CompletionRequested { position: TextPosition }
CodeAction::SegmentActivated { key: ItemKey }
```

The caller receives the proposed committed text or typed request and decides
how to apply it. No draw path mutates the source.

### Durable state

`CodeEditorState` contains shared text/editor state, source revision, selection
and caret, vertical/horizontal viewport, find query/matches/current match,
completion controller, edit/read-only mode, and any diagnostics display state.
It does not own the source document, language service, or file operations.

Source-keyed selection/caret ranges are reconciled on revision changes. Stale
completion ranges and highlighting/projection caches are discarded rather than
applied against new offsets.

## Update, draw, and measure

`update` is the only mutating phase. It routes overlay/completion priority,
find editing, keyboard editing/navigation, pointer caret placement and
selection, scroll, and typed actions. It validates read-only before dispatch on
every event so a mode change cannot leave an edit path open.

`draw` reads the document and state, computes one source-to-display projection,
then paints gutter, line numbers, current-line indication, syntax, diagnostics,
selection, caret, find marks, completion, scrollbar, and fade. Styles never
change logical text coordinates. The candidate must not mutate durable state
while painting.

`measure` computes line count, gutter width, text area, completion anchor, and
scroll geometry from current constraints. Resize invalidates only the relevant
projection/cache facts and keeps semantic caret/selection where valid.

## Editing and navigation behavior

Read-only mode still supports focus, caret positioning, navigation, selection,
copy, find, and scrolling. It rejects insert, delete, indent, dedent, paste,
and commit. A click in read-only moves the caret without creating a document
edit.

Editable mode uses the shared text core. Enter or `i` begins editing; `a`
enters and moves right. Escape cancels/commits according to the shared editor
policy captured from the baseline; the committed target API exposes the result
as `Commit` or `Cancelled`, never an untyped side effect. Ctrl+Enter/other
configured commit keys commit without changing document text. Multiline paste
is one edit operation with grapheme-safe cursor and selection behavior.

Tab and BackTab either indent/dedent a selected range or insert configured
indentation. `TabBehavior` can instead commit and emit a leave action for a
form-like composition. This policy is explicit; it cannot be inferred from
the component caller.

Navigation uses arrows or `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End and `g`/`G`.
`{`/`}` jump between caller-supplied blocks where the document provides them.
`i` begins editing, `a` begins editing and moves right, and Enter begins editing.
`/` opens find;
find query editing supports insertion, grapheme-safe backspace, paste,
Enter/Shift+Enter next/previous, and Escape cancellation. `n`/`N` navigate
matches. Query edits rebase ranges from original source offsets after case
expansion and Unicode segmentation.

Pointer click enters editing once in writable mode and places the caret at the
display position; drag extends source selection. Runtime owns focus, hit and
capture. Release outside must end drag safely. Completion and find overlays
receive input before the editor body when they are active.

## Visual contract

Parts are `container`, `gutter`, `line-number`, `current-line`, `text`,
`syntax`, `selection`, `cursor`, `diagnostic`, `find`, `completion`,
`scrollbar`, and `fade`.

The baseline appearance, spacing, focus gutter, current-line treatment,
diagnostic marks, cursor visibility, completion placement, and scrollbar/fade
policy remain unchanged. Read-only is visibly distinct from disabled while
remaining navigable. Focused monochrome output keeps the baseline navigation
gutter.

The frozen gutter is `▎ marker nn`: `▎` marks the cursor line, `›` the current
block, the spinner a running block, and `!` a diagnostic. The current line
number is bold; other line numbers in the current block are secondary. The
footer shows the find bar or nearest diagnostic on the left and a position such
as `ln 1/26 · col 18` on the right. Syntax tones are supplied by the caller;
selection uses the popover plane, find matches and bracket matches use their
documented underline/bold roles, and diagnostics underline the affected range.

One display mapping handles tabs, line numbers, styled runs, diagnostics,
selection, completion anchor, and cursor. Grapheme clusters, combining marks,
wide characters, and nonzero-origin/narrow regions never split cells or write
outside the allocation. Truecolor/256/16/no-color style resolution and motion
use shared foundations.

No generic whole-editor activation feedback is added. Cursor, find, completion,
and diagnostic emphasis use only applicable shared timing and reduced-motion
rules.

## State matrix

| Axis | Required states | Applies when |
|---|---|---|
| Geometry | `normal`, `zero_area`, `tiny_area`, `nonzero_origin`, `exact_fit`, `one_cell_short`, `unicode_long_content`, `narrow_then_wide` | Always |
| Focus/hover | unfocused, focused, hovered, focus+hover, keyboard-suppressed hover, pointer motion restores hover | Interactive editor/popup |
| Activation | No generic whole-editor activation; edit, commit, find, completion, and selection actions are typed | Editor recipe |
| Editing | navigation, editing, selected text, invalid, read-only, commit, cancel, blur, tab traversal, source revision conflict | Editor mode |
| Scroll | no overflow, start, middle, end, wheel boundary, thumb drag, resize while scrolled, edge fade, protected cursor row | Overflow exists |
| Output | source replaced, source appended, selection, source copy, cursor clipped | Source changes/selection |
| Readiness | loading/error diagnostics or completion state only when caller supplies it | Provider state |
| Motion | every applicable cursor/completion/feedback phase, paused/reduced motion | Theme policy |

## Capture and acceptance contract

Use [`../reference/capture-plans/code-editor.json`](../reference/capture-plans/code-editor.json).
It is planned, with no expected artifacts. Bind baseline captures as
`ExistingOracle`/`ExtractedOracle`; new robustness or API guarantees are
`Extension`.

Run applicable cases at `72×20`, `80×24`, `100×30`, `120×40`, and `160×50`
with truecolor, 256-color, 16-color, `none`, and `nocolor` capabilities.

| Case | Required observation |
|---|---|
| W29-01 | Read-only click/caret/selection never mutates the document. |
| W29-02 | Edit mode, commit/cancel, and multiline paste preserve source ranges. |
| W29-03 | Find next/previous, grapheme query edits, and query cancellation. |
| W29-04 | Diagnostic, selection, current line, and syntax overlap correctly. |
| W29-05 | Completion popup remains anchored to the caret after resize. |
| W29-06 | Tab expansion and styled-run grapheme boundaries stay aligned. |
| W29-07 | Long document performs visible-only highlight/draw work under policy. |

Record dimensions, exact cells, symbols/continuations, colors/modifiers,
cursor position/visibility, focus/capture/layer owners, source revision,
selection/caret, draft/committed text, completion/find state, typed action
count and target. Draw cannot create expected output.

## Required negative tests

- Read-only consumers cannot mutate the document through any action path,
  including Tab, BackTab, paste, completion, or a mode switch during editing.
- `draw` cannot commit, alter caret/selection/scroll, change source revision,
  or consume completion/find actions.
- A source replacement invalidates stale find, diagnostic, highlight, and
  completion ranges.
- Selection/cursor mapping cannot split graphemes, tabs, controls, or wide
  cells; copy returns source text.
- Narrow, zero, tiny, and nonzero-origin editor/find allocations cannot panic or
  paint outside their area.
- Scrollbar drag reaches exact top/bottom and leaves no capture on release.
- Completion/diagnostic customization cannot replace editor layout or focus
  ownership.
