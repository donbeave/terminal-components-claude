# TextArea

**Component ID:** W09\
**Group:** Forms\
**Phase:** P3\
**Contract status:** canonical Termrock target; implementation is future work on `termrock-refactor`.

## Purpose and scope

`TextArea` is a multiline controlled editor. The caller owns committed text and revision. Durable state owns multiline draft/editor positions, selection, vertical and horizontal scroll, edit phase, and follow-caret policy. Field chrome and text operations are shared with TextInput; they are not copied into a second editor.

### Non-goals

- No document persistence, product editor semantics, schema, or domain side effects.
- No generic widget trait or universal editor policy.
- No paste or Escape behavior copied from TextInput: TextArea intentionally differs.
- No geometry or palette stored in editor state.

## Oracle and provenance

The immutable oracle is [`4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`](https://github.com/donbeave/terminal-components-claude/commit/4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b). Current source is [`src/widgets/textarea.rs`](../../src/widgets/textarea.rs), legacy `TextArea`, source blob `5bfa5148a8b335c28ed52a5af305fa9df39917e5`; shared Field/edit helpers are [`src/widgets/field_common.rs`](../../src/widgets/field_common.rs), blob `bd41cdd85e9c2605c356f7468dc0de3e3c50e54b`. Showcase textarea captures are protected baseline consumers. Current source tests cover read-only scrolling, boundary wheels, Unicode click/cursor geometry, manual scroll, resize, and narrow allocations.

Use [`capture-plans/text-area.json`](../reference/capture-plans/text-area.json), W09, planned and without expected artifacts. Bind source output before candidates.

## Public API and ownership

```rust
TextArea::new(id: Id, value: &'a str, revision: Revision)
    -> TextArea<'a, Plain>
TextArea::secret(id: Id, value: &'a Secret, revision: Revision)
    -> TextArea<'a, SecretText>

area.update(&mut cx, &mut state) -> Response<TextAction<M::Value>>
area.draw(&mut ui, area, &state) -> Rect
area.measure(&measure_cx, constraints) -> Size
```

Builders: `label(&'a str)`, `help(&'a str)`, `rows(u16)`, `disabled(bool)`, `read_only(bool)`, `validation(Option<&'a ValidationMessage>)`, `wrap(WrapMode)`, `patch(StylePatch)`, and `conflict_policy(ConflictPolicy)` (default `PreserveDraftAndReport`).

`TextAreaState<Plain>` contains shared editor state, multiline caret/selection, vertical/horizontal scroll, edit phase, and follow-caret. Secret specialization is redacted and non-Clone like TextInput. Safe observations are `phase()`, `caret()`, `selection()`, `resolve_conflict()`, and Plain-only `draft()`. Typed actions are `TextAction<V>::{ Edited, Commit { value: V }, Cancelled, Conflict }`; an explicit cancel command is distinct from the baseline Escape binding.

## Update, draw, and measure

- `update` handles navigation scrolling, edit grammar, wheel, paste, and focus transitions. Enter/F2 or completed click enters edit. Enter while editing inserts a newline. Escape finishes and commits TextArea editing; Tab/Shift+Tab commits and traverses.
- `draw` is semantically immutable. It paints Field chrome, visible lines, selection, cursor, scrollbar, and fades from state. It must not commit, mutate scroll, or recalculate semantic values as a side effect.
- `measure` accounts for label, body rows, help/error line, text viewport, and scrollbar. It preserves source offsets across wrapped lines, empty final lines, and resize.

## Identity, reconciliation, and conflict

Stable `Id` owns runtime focus/hit/capture. Draft/editor state follows that ID and source revision. Reorder does not move a draft to a neighboring field; removal releases runtime ownership and clears secret material. External revision changes during edit use explicit conflict policy and never silently overwrite.

## Visual contract

Parts are `container`, `label`, `gutter`, `text`, `selection`, `cursor`, `help`, `error`, `scrollbar`, and `fade`. [`Field`](field.md) owns shared chrome; [`ScrollRegion`](scroll-region.md) owns scrolling/thumb/fade mechanism. Preserve baseline body fill, focus gutter, cursor, selection modifiers, line clipping, horizontal ellipsis, vertical scrollbar, edge fades, disabled/error colors, and narrow height behavior. Supported patches cannot replace geometry, focus/capture, or whole surface.

The baseline body contains the configured text rows with a two-cell inset. An
optional scrollbar takes one column. The footer keeps help/error at left and
`ln 3/12` or `a–b of N` at right. While editing, the current line has a
`border-strong` underline. Long lines scroll horizontally to reveal the
insertion point; an offscreen hardware cursor is hidden rather than painted
over unrelated text.

## Interaction and state rules

| Area | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Keyboard | Navigation arrows/HJK/PageUp/PageDown/Home/End scroll. Enter/F2 enters edit. Editing arrows and movement change caret; PageUp/PageDown move caret by rows. Enter inserts newline. Escape commits (the intentional TextArea exception). Tab/Shift+Tab commits and traverses. |
| Paste | Paste requires editing already active; navigation-mode paste is ignored. Bracketed multiline paste preserves newlines. This is intentionally different from TextInput. |
| Pointer/wheel | One click enters editing and maps to line/column; wheel scrolls without changing focus. Runtime owns pointer capture and clipped hit areas. |
| Focus/hover | Focus is separate from edit mode. Losing focus commits per shared blur policy. Keyboard suppresses stale hover. |
| Disabled/read-only | Disabled cannot edit/paste/capture. Read-only can navigate/scroll and show selection per policy but cannot mutate text. |
| Scroll | Navigation arrows/page keys scroll the viewport. A manual wheel or thumb move preserves its offset and may leave the caret offscreen; wheel alone does not ensure it. During editing, a later keyboard step first moves the caret, then minimally scrolls to reveal that new position. Cursor movement, edits, and resize may reveal it; an offscreen hardware cursor stays hidden. Test boundaries and thumb capture. |
| Resize/Unicode | Keep source offsets over wrapped lines, tabs, newlines, empty final lines, combining/wide graphemes; clip writes to body. |
| Capability/color | Resolve field, selection, cursor, scrollbar, fade, error, and disabled styles semantically across capabilities. |
| Motion | Shared scroll fade policy only; no private animation loop. |

## Applicable state matrix

| Axis | Cases |
|---|---|
| Geometry | normal, zero area, tiny area, nonzero origin, exact fit, one cell short, long Unicode, narrow then wide |
| Focus/hover | unfocused, focused, hovered, focus+hover, keyboard-suppressed hover, pointer motion restores hover |
| Activation | not applicable as generic whole-surface activation; edit/scroll/selection gestures apply |
| Editing | navigation, editing, selected text, invalid, read-only, commit, finish via Escape, blur, Tab traversal, source revision conflict |
| Scroll | no overflow, start, middle, end, wheel boundary, thumb drag, resize while scrolled, edge fade, protected row |

## Required capture cases

| Case | Exact requirement |
|---|---|
| W09-01 | Edit Enter inserts newline; Escape commits and leaves edit mode. |
| W09-02 | Navigation-mode paste is ignored; edit-mode bracketed paste preserves newlines. |
| W09-03 | PageUp/PageDown and Home/End in navigation versus editing. |
| W09-04 | Selection spans newline, tab, and grapheme boundaries. |
| W09-05 | Wheel while editing followed by caret movement; follow-caret resumes correctly. |
| W09-06 | Height 0/1 and `rows+2` Field layout. |

Capture all applicable cases at 72×20, 80×24, 100×30, 120×40, and 160×50 under truecolor, 256, 16, none, and nocolor. Record exact cells, cursor, focus/capture/layer owner, scroll offset, caret/selection/source offsets, draft/committed values (redacted for secrets), and typed action count/target.

## Negative tests and acceptance

- Escape commits TextArea and never rolls back as TextInput does.
- Navigation paste never inserts; edit paste preserves newlines.
- Draw cannot mutate text, caret, scroll, or commit state.
- Manual wheel scroll remains until the documented follow-caret trigger.
- Resize, empty final lines, and Unicode boundaries cannot lose source offsets or write outside body.
- Secret text never appears in debug/log/clipboard/snapshot/post-close state.
- Candidate output cannot become expected output.

Accept after API, state/action, exact visual, scrolling, Unicode, secret, conflict, and independent review gates pass.
