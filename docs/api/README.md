# Termrock API

This directory is the canonical public API contract for the in-place Termrock refactor. It describes the proposed API that the `termrock-refactor` branch will implement progressively from the frozen `visual-baseline` commit. The signatures are design declarations until the P1 API freeze; they do not claim that the current Rust crate already exposes these names.

## Read in this order

1. [Public API contract](public-api.md) — ownership, phases, response flow, reconciliation, and component-facing rules.
2. [Shared types and models](types.md) — identity, geometry, runtime values, rows, model traits, and terminal-cell inputs.
3. [Authoring contract](authoring.md) — the constrained extension surface for generic component and part authors.
4. [Component catalog](../components/README.md) — the 45 component/API contracts and their behavior cases.

The API is coordinated with the [architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md), [runtime contract](../foundations/runtime.md), [input and actions](../foundations/input-actions.md), [layout](../foundations/layout.md), [layers](../foundations/layers.md), [theme](../foundations/theme.md), and [identity foundation](../foundations/identity.md). Those documents own their respective mechanisms; this directory owns how callers use them.

## Status and authority

This is a target contract, not an implementation report. The current source still contains legacy names such as `junie_tui`, `WidgetId`, `Outcome`, and `RenderCtx`. They are implementation evidence during the refactor, not future public compatibility requirements. No source or crate rename has happened in the documentation-only phase.

The API is for this repository and its future in-place Termrock library. No second repository, clean-room implementation, or application project is part of this contract. `showcase`, `tablepro`, `jackin-preview`, and `holla` remain parity consumers of the library; their frozen output is governed by [visual verification](../verification/visual-parity.md).

The pinned visual source is commit `4a79c0a2d40fca46fc406b77157ce3b3f12ec16b`. It owns appearance and observable interaction. API choices may simplify ownership and composition, but they do not authorize a visual redesign.

## Proposal and freeze rule

Before P1 API freeze, external-consumer probes may adjust exact Rust spelling when the ownership contract remains intact. A spelling change must update this directory, the affected component contract, and the source/family mapping together. After P1 freeze, component work may not invent per-component response shapes, add hidden state ownership, widen runtime access, or silently add compatibility aliases.
