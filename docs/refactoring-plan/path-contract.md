# Verification path contract

**Authority:** This document is the single canonical reference for filesystem paths used by `taskfmt verify` and `tc-proof-host`. Task packages (`verify.toml`) use **container paths** literally; taskfmt does **not** rewrite subprocess argv.

Related: [`task-001-verify-container.md`](task-001-verify-container.md), [`task-production-verify-container.md`](task-production-verify-container.md), [`proof-contract.md`](proof-contract.md).

## Three namespaces

| Namespace | Examples | Who owns it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Container verification** | `/task`, `/work`, `/proof/bootstrap`, `/proof/bin`, `/run/tc-proof` | Host must expose at filesystem root before checks run |
| **Host operator** | `$REPO`, `.worktrees/campaign`, `/tmp/taskfmt-install`, `$TC_RUN` | Operator maps into container namespace |
| **Campaign store** | `campaign/` or `.campaign/host/` (bootstrap, catalog, runs, ledger) | Host only; never candidate-writable |

---

## taskfmt behavior (no argv rewriting)

`taskfmt verify --root`, `--task-dir`, and `TASKFMT_*` env vars affect **taskfmt's own** gate (lint, scope, forbidden paths, progress). They do **not** change `verify.toml` check argv.

Every subprocess in `verify.toml` runs with:

- `argv` exactly as written in the package
- `current_dir` = `--root` (typically `/work`)

**Passing `--task-dir /path/to/catalog/001` does not make `/task/...` resolve.** Root-level mounts (or a sandbox script) are mandatory.

## TASK-001 bootstrap layout (001, 070)

Required at filesystem root when CHK checks execute:

```text
/task/                                    → read-only task package (completion/NNN)
/work/                                    → candidate git checkout (taskfmt CWD)
/proof/bootstrap/bin/taskfmt              → pinned standalone taskfmt
/proof/bootstrap/task-format/              → source @ 52d9f1eb…
/proof/bootstrap/experiment.toml            → frozen config bytes
/work/tools/refactor-proof/bin/tc-proof     → synced Mach-O (after sync-binaries.sh)
/work/tools/refactor-proof/bin/tc-proof-host → synced Mach-O (after sync-binaries.sh)
```

Provision with [`scripts/task-001-verify-sandbox.sh`](../../scripts/task-001-verify-sandbox.sh) (`prepare` + `mount`). Hybrid **071/072** also need [`scripts/hybrid-verify-sandbox.sh`](../../scripts/hybrid-verify-sandbox.sh) (`prepare-hybrid` + operator `/run` firmlink).

### Harness binary roles

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `target/debug/tc-proof-host` | Built Mach-O — **advisory** driver runs on bare macOS only |
| `tools/refactor-proof/bin/tc-proof-host` | Synced Mach-O — **required** for `verify.toml` CHK-005/006/007 (container path `/work/tools/.../bin/tc-proof-host`) |
| `scripts/dev-tc-proof-host.sh` | Shell wrapper — dev only; never sync to `bin/` |

---

## TASK-002+ production layout (002–069, 073; hybrid 071–072)

Required at filesystem root:

```text
/task/                                    → read-only task package
/work/                                    → frozen candidate checkout
/progress/progress.md                     → frozen nonempty progress (or explicit --progress path)
/proof/bin/tc-proof                       → host-installed accepted harness worker
/run/tc-proof/context-index.json          → frozen by host prepare/freeze
/run/tc-proof/contexts/CHK-NNN.json       → one per declared check
```

Host `tc-proof-host prepare` materializes contexts; `freeze` binds the candidate tree. See [`task-production-verify-container.md`](task-production-verify-container.md).

### Task bands in verify.toml

| Tasks | Check argv pattern |
| --- | --- |
| **001, 070** | Bootstrap Python under `/task/trusted/…`; `/proof/bootstrap/` for taskfmt |
| **071, 072** | Hybrid: CHK-001 → `/proof/bin/tc-proof preflight`; others → bootstrap drivers |
| **002–069, 073** | All checks → `/proof/bin/tc-proof <op> --context /run/tc-proof/contexts/CHK-NNN.json` |

---

## Worktree contract (campaign)

| Phase | Worktree | Branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campaign execution | `.worktrees/campaign` | `refactor/holla-parity` |
| Planning catalog (read-only) | repo checkout | `prep-wave1-verify` (archive after SHA recorded) |

Historical prep-wave1 docs may reference `.worktrees/main` @ `task-001-bootstrap`; after campaign init, **all production work uses `.worktrees/campaign`**.

---

## taskfmt verify invocation (canonical)

After container mounts exist:

```sh
cd /work
taskfmt --config /proof/bootstrap/experiment.toml verify \
  --base "$SCOPE_BASE" \
  --progress "$PROGRESS" \
  --log-dir "$LOG_DIR"
```

Optional `--root /work --task-dir /task` for taskfmt internal resolution only.

---

## Host run directory (operator)

```text
$TC_RUN/                    # e.g. /tmp/tc-task-001-run-* or campaign/runs/<id>/
  progress.md
  taskfmt-logs/CHK-*.log
  contexts/                 # host-side; mount as /run/tc-proof/contexts/
  freeze.json
  verdict.json
```

`$TC_RUN` is **not** the same as container `/run/tc-proof/` — the host maps between them.
