# Planning completion audit

This register evaluates all twenty items in [docs/sources/PLANNING_GOAL.md §22](../sources/PLANNING_GOAL.md). It tracks planning readiness, not completion of the future refactoring. Investigations can be evidence-complete while verification qualification or final independent acceptance remains incomplete.

Current overall assessment: **reopened; closer to READY on mechanical gates but still NOT READY overall**. A renewed source-first, line-by-line audit has identified additional scope and contract gaps. See [the re-audit register](reaudit-plan.md). All twenty conditions require renewed current evidence after repairs. Qualified preparation is not a claim that the future production harness or refactored applications already pass.

## Current §22 tally (2026-09-15 verification round)

| Status | Count | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **Proven** (current affirmative evidence) | **19** | §22.1–§22.6, §22.7–§22.11, §22.12–§22.16, §22.18–§22.19, §22.20 |
| **Unproven** (open re-audit work or failed gate) | **1** | §22.17 |

Re-audit register: **49 closed / 0 open** ([`reaudit-findings.tsv`](reaudit-findings.tsv); empty `remaining` = closed). Bootstrap `--runner` deferrals (CLOSURE-02, FND-01/02, STR-01–03, ROOT-07, BA-ART-01) and **BRANCH-01** closed at the planning-bootstrap / coordinator-integration boundary; TASK-072/067/070 own submitted execution receipts later.

### Phase 0 mechanical gates (this round)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `validate-plan.py --summary` | **PASS** — `error_count: 0`, 647 historical prose sections, 3243 traceability edges |
| `assemble-plan.py` / `derive-task-graph.py` | **PASS** — idempotent (`written: false`, `changed: []`); depth 35, 24 longest paths |
| `taskfmt project lint terminal-components` | **PASS** — 73/73 packages, 0 errors |
| `freeze-bootstrap-assets.py --check` (all 7 groups) | **PASS** — 211 bootstrap assets, 0 changed |
| `cargo nextest run -E 'test(store_integrity)'` | **PASS** — 1/1 @ `623a1a59` |
| `cargo nextest run --profile ci --run-ignored only -E 'binary(visual_baseline)'` | **PASS** — 7550/7550 (~110 s) |

| §22 item | Required proof | Previous pass assessment and evidence — not current readiness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Immutable UI/UX reference pinned | Evidence complete. Peeled oracle and annotated tag identities are recorded in [history](history.md) and [progress](PROGRESS.md). |
| 2 | Branch history and divergence understood | **Proven (planning boundary).** [History](history.md) records topology; JT/TTE/xtask/components-B partitions integrated; closure partition 244/244 disposition-bound ([coordinator witness](reaudit-branch-coordinator-integration.md)); inventory sync **752/7885** reviewed — whole-branch semantic acceptance not claimed. |
| 3 | Meaningful historical versions reconstructed | **Proven (planning-investigation boundary).** HIST-01 closed: 281 revision-index edges, 13 paths, 647 prose sections ([witness](reaudit-history-witness.md)); EH-03/EH-04 and HAR-LOCATORS synchronized. Full 620-clause semantic re-audit remains future execution evidence. |
| 4 | Accepted/rejected/superseded decisions distinguished | **Proven (planning boundary).** [Decision ledger](decision-ledger.tsv), [architecture-adjudication.md](architecture-adjudication.md) ADJ-01–22 including components-B ADJ-22; ROOT-08 closed. |
| 5 | Current main known component by component | Investigation complete: [32 ARCH rows](architecture-matrix.tsv), [54 COMP families](component-parity.tsv), [architecture](architecture.md) and [component audit](components.md). Measured preservation is distinguished from remaining implementation/proof. |
| 6 | Four apps inventoried against oracle | Investigation complete: [Showcase](showcase.md), [Holla](holla.md), [Jackin](jackin.md), [TablePro](tablepro.md). |
| 7 | Important visible states/flows inventoried | Proven. [361 scenarios](application-parity.tsv), 84 derived Jackin/TablePro identities and 35 named Holla/shell contributions have complete source/owner/proof bindings; [parity rereview](review-parity-repairs.md) accepts staging and native/resized coverage. |
| 8 | Deterministic visual/behavioral regression detection | **Proven (planning boundary).** Seven bootstrap freeze groups (211 assets including capture-atomicity); CLOSURE-02, FND-01/02, ROOT-07, STR-01–03, BA-ART-01 closed at planning-bootstrap qualification; CI smoke 7550/7550. Production `tc-proof-host` and TASK-072 `--runner` receipts remain future work. |
| 9 | Tui-snap gaps resolved or actual PR dependency | **Proven.** [PR #1](https://github.com/donbeave/tui-snap/pull/1) merged; campaign pins `0a2e490802b7b048cd96349c6af860f8a3a05c3d` (includes reviewed head `883d03f19d890bbbf27468798db78b04e85297ac`). [Independent tool review](tuisnap-review.md) and CI smoke (7550/7550) apply. This is not approval of the separate project harness. |
| 10 | All architecture obligations mapped to tasks | Proven. [Traceability](traceability-components.tsv) covers 32 ARCH, 54 COMP and eight decisions; registry non-frame classification and actual architecture witnesses passed [rereview](review-contract-repairs.md). |
| 11 | All important parity obligations mapped to automation | Proven. [Application matrix](application-parity.tsv), exact source-derived contributions and [parity rereview](review-parity-repairs.md) preserve all intact parents and their valid automated closing owners. |
| 12 | Every implementation task follows current task-format | Proven. All 73 packages pass pinned canonical lint with zero errors/warnings, including final TASK-072 AC-009/CHK-011. [Format identity](task-format.md) was remotely reconfirmed. |
| 13 | Every task has complete explicit contract fields | Proven. [Task index](task-index.tsv), canonical lint, exact payload checks and [contract rereview](review-contract-repairs.md) establish requirements, typed acceptance, commands, scope, dependencies and authority. |
| 14 | Complete DAG valid and execution-ready | Proven at planning boundary. [Graph](task-graph.md) has depth33 and24 longest paths; receipts, preparation transitions and observer contracts passed independent contract and executable qualification review. |
| 15 | Parallel and serialized work identified | Proven. [Derived graph](task-graph.md) has zero unordered scope overlaps; hard serialization, isolated worktrees and reverified parallel joins are explicit and mechanically checked. |
| 16 | Final integration/merge-readiness gate exists | Proven. [TASK-069](../../refactoring-tasks/terminal-components/completion/069/README.md) requires complete unfiltered system/parity/architecture proof, exact ancestry and no automatic main update. Host/integration contracts passed independent review. |
| 17 | Independent subagents reviewed plan | **Unproven.** Five original `review-*-final.md` reports plus repair rereviews exist; [`campaign-execution-prompt.md`](campaign-execution-prompt.md) requires a **fresh** independent witness round on frozen catalog bytes post-repair (including components-B ADJ-22 and coordinator integration @ current tip). |
| 18 | Material findings incorporated or evidence-backed rejected | **Proven.** Re-audit register **49/49** closed ([`reaudit-findings.tsv`](reaudit-findings.tsv)); original [review-findings.tsv](review-findings.tsv) closures retained. |
| 19 | No known requirement orphaned | Proven. [Traceability](traceability.tsv) has3,159 edges over1,159 source IDs; all620 historical clauses, protected payloads,84 derived identities and35 additional named contributions pass exact joins with no orphan task/source/check mapping. |
| 20 | No important UI/UX behavior without owner and proof | **Proven (planning boundary).** Traceability joins pass; components-B coordinator projection and closure-partition disposition bindings complete ([witness](reaudit-branch-coordinator-integration.md)). Future runtime parity is not pre-accepted. |

## Previous pass additional deliverable checks

- [docs/sources/REFACTORING_COMPLETION_PLAN.md](../sources/REFACTORING_COMPLETION_PLAN.md) contains all24 required sections. Required matrices, current tool/source pins and complete canonical packages are present; [executed verification](planning-verification.md) records their checks.
- Canonical graph, source ledgers, protected clauses, all derived contributions and typed R/AC/CHK references pass final cross-artifact validation. [Frozen bootstrap hashes](bootstrap-assets.tsv) bind211 assets; [complete artifact hashes](planning-artifacts.tsv) bind the delivered planning tree.
- Oracle source, membership, expected frames, comparison policy and judge inputs are protected. Independently qualified mutation fixtures cover exact inline-test spans, untrusted extraction, real preparation transitions, qualified closure, host isolation and actual production ownership witnesses.
- Current task-format schemas are preserved. [Campaign executor adaptation](campaign-executor-protocol.md) explicitly reconciles canonical template provenance with operator-controlled frozen verification, complete progress and host-only acceptance.
- Existing histories, render archives and old self-baselines retain their source provenance; none are relabeled as new-oracle parity. Future numeric captures and bundle hashes are prerequisite outputs, not fabricated evidence.
- All build/test/lint/docs/backend/API/architecture/registry/performance and four-app obligations have concrete contract owners. Independently reviewed qualification supplies the future acceptance gate; actual final implementation execution remains required, not inferred from planning or lint.
- This goal has not executed terminal-components production refactoring, the task campaign, integration branch creation, merges or publication. The scoped external tui-snap PR is a distinct explicitly permitted dependency.

## Completion rule

The reopened goal is incomplete until every planning condition has affirmative evidence for the repaired current artifacts. The previous table is retained as historical evidence, not a present verdict. No historical PASS report or intended future command substitutes for source-first audit, executable preparation tests and independent repair reviews. Any change to source, task contracts, trusted fixtures or integration assumptions requires applicable requalification and a new artifact identity; the plan does not authorize its own weakening or automatic implementation/merge.
