# Independent fresh witness — §22.17 planning readiness (2026-09-15)

**Catalog commit:** `3213fce285268925520be20b14aa8a1c4b136586` (`visual-baseline`)  
**Witness type:** Fresh independent adversarial review on **post-repair frozen catalog bytes** (includes components-B ADJ-22, coordinator integration @ tip, campaign prep docs).  
**Scope:** Planning / Phase 0 only. No production refactoring, no TASK-001 dispatch, no oracle blessing, no `READY FOR REFACTORING EXECUTION` issuance.

---

## Overall verdict

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **§22.17 fresh witness round complete?** | **Yes** — five independent partition reviewers + coordinator synthesis |
| **Issue `READY FOR REFACTORING EXECUTION` now?** | **No** — material P1 catalog gaps remain (see § Open findings) |
| **Mechanical gates @ catalog SHA?** | **Green** — `validate-plan.py` 0 errors; 73/73 taskfmt lint; 7/7 bootstrap freeze groups |

**Partition summary:** 1 **VERIFIED** (parity/traceability), 4 **REJECTED** (DAG/receipts, architecture/integration projection, verification/bootstrap, closure/TASK-069). Rejection means the catalog can pass lint while execution-critical bindings remain prose-only or overclaimed — not that the witness failed to run.

## Witness methodology

Five fresh-context subagents reviewed disjoint partitions adversarially. Instruction:

> Assume the planners optimized for passing lint while violating source requirements. Find concrete ways this catalog passes mechanical checks while breaking architecture, receipts, disposition authority, or merge-readiness claims.

Coordinator re-verified the highest-severity findings on frozen bytes before recording them here. Prior `review-*-final.md` reports (2026-09-11) are **historical**; this document supersedes them for §22.17 closure at catalog SHA `3213fce2`.

### Mechanical measurements (coordinator + witnesses)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 docs/refactoring-plan/evidence/validate-plan.py --summary` | **PASS** — `error_count: 0`, 363 scenarios, 3258 traceability edges, graph depth 35 |
| `taskfmt project lint terminal-components` (pinned `experiment.toml`) | **PASS** — 73/73 |
| `freeze-bootstrap-assets.py --check` (7 groups) | **PASS** — 211 assets, 0 changed |
| `derive-task-graph.py` | **PASS** — 73 tasks, depth 35, 24 longest paths, 0 scope overlaps |
| `tools/refactor-proof/bin/tc-proof-host` | **ABSENT** (expected; TASK-001 deliverable) |

## Prior finding disposition (DAG-FINAL / INT / VF)

| Prior ID | Original severity | Disposition @ `3213fce2` | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAG-FINAL-01 | P1 receipt cycle | **accepted-risk** — repaired in `proof-contract.md` + TASK-071 fixtures; mode only in host context JSON | WITNESS-01 |
| DAG-FINAL-02 | P1 TASK-008 inline scope | **closed** — 146 source paths in `008/verify.toml` + span manifest | span-only intent is prose/CHK-006 |
| DAG-FINAL-03 | P1 observation ownership | **closed** — canonical rule + per-task extraction seams | seam paths not lint-checked |
| DAG-FINAL-04 | P2 taskfmt config | **closed** — explicit `--config` in docs | — |
| DAG-FINAL-05 | P2 stale counts | **closed** — depth 35, 620 historical rows | — |
| INT-01 | High branch order | **closed** — coordinator accepted; docs aligned | — |
| INT-02 | Medium AGENTS conflict | **open** | READINESS-04 |
| INT-03 | High freeze index distrust | **open** — fixture gap documented | execution prerequisite |
| VF-01 | P1 `--group` ABI | **closed** — catalog uses `070`/`071`/`072` | — |

## Open findings (block `READY FOR REFACTORING EXECUTION`)

Material P1 items require catalog repair **or** explicit accepted-risk disposition with evidence before arming the campaign `/goal`.

| ID | Sev | Finding | Evidence | Required disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **READINESS-01** | **P1** | Coordinator marks TASK-031 branch witness projection **integrated**, but `031/trusted/source-witnesses.md` contains only `W-031-01`…`W-031-11` — not `W-021-07`…`W-028-06` listed in [`branch-diff-components-b-coordinator-projection.tsv`](branch-diff-components-b-coordinator-projection.tsv) row 3 | Coordinator TSV vs on-disk trusted bytes | Promote branch witness IDs into TASK-031 trusted manifest **or** freeze host CHK-006 context template in catalog; reconcile TSV `planning_status` |
| **READINESS-02** | **P1** | **`W-042-JUMP-SUBMIT` incorrectly projected into TASK-031** — TASK-031 predecessors stop at TASK-030; TASK-042 depends on TASK-041 | `task-index.tsv`, graph | Remove from TASK-031 projection; keep on TASK-042 only |
| **READINESS-03** | **P1** | TASK-008 disposition TSV **not bound in trusted package** — coordinator row 5 cites `008/trusted/obligations.md`; **zero** references to `W-021-07`, `W-025-07/08`, `W-026-05`; disposition targets `crates/tui/tests/*` absent from `inline-test-source-scope.md` | Grep + TSV vs obligations | Import disposition rows + external-test span manifest into TASK-008 trusted inputs |
| **WITNESS-01** | **P1** | Preparation vs production accounting mode specified only in host context JSON, not catalog-visible verify argv — mis-bound host can recreate DAG-FINAL-01 receipt cycle | `proof-contract.md` §136–144 vs identical TASK-002–008 CHK argv | Machine-bind mode in trusted context templates or distinct check argv |
| **READINESS-04** | **P1** | **INT-02 live:** canonical `AGENTS.md` step 7 instructs forbidden `taskfmt verify --progress ""`; campaign adaptation supersedes in prose only | All 73 packages; `campaign-executor-protocol.md` | Campaign-visible AGENTS overlay or lint rule |
| **READINESS-05** | **P1** | TASK-069 **CHK-007 (`close`) bound to human adversarial review** obligations it cannot enforce | `069/trusted/obligations.md` clause 6 vs `verify.toml` | Decouple human review from machine gate; map to coordinator evidence |
| **READINESS-06** | **P2** | Merge-readiness drift detection + fidelity-tier full visual matrix asserted in obligations prose, not frozen in catalog check contexts | TASK-069 obligations clause 7; campaign prompt §4 | Freeze in host context spec adjacent to catalog |
| **READINESS-07** | **P2** | `planning-acceptance.md` stale counts (361 scenarios / 3159 edges vs live 363 / 3258) | validate-plan counts | Doc sync only |
| **READINESS-08** | **P2** | Runner context-index qualification runs on `--group 070` only; TASK-071/072 verify paths skip index suite | `runner-bootstrap-driver.py`, verify.toml | Wire index check or document transitive TASK-070 receipt requirement |

**Known non-blockers (documented deferrals):** absent `tc-proof-host` (TASK-001); 363/363 scenarios REQUIRED-UNCAPTURED; 752/7885 branch inventory paths without semantic review; Darwin-only host isolation fixtures (INT-03).

## §22.17 closure statement

Independent subagents **have reviewed** the frozen catalog at `3213fce2` across parity, DAG, architecture, verification, and integration partitions. This satisfies PLANNING_GOAL §22 item 17 (**independent subagent review**) at the **witness-completeness** boundary.

It does **not** satisfy the campaign Phase 0 gate **`READY FOR REFACTORING EXECUTION`**, which additionally requires closing or explicitly accepting READINESS-01–05 (and operator authorization).

---

## Recommended next steps

1. **Repair READINESS-01–03** — align coordinator projection TSV with on-disk TASK-031/008 trusted bytes (highest priority; closes components-B integration overclaim).
2. **Repair READINESS-04** — resolve INT-02 AGENTS/campaign contradiction machine-visibly.
3. **Disposition WITNESS-01** — either catalog-bind preparation mode or qualify host-context rejection fixtures in frozen trusted templates.
4. **Repair READINESS-05–06** — decouple human review from TASK-069 CHK-007; freeze fidelity visual + merge-readiness commands in inspectable context bindings.
5. **Re-run witness spot-check** on repaired bytes (at minimum partitions C, D, E).
6. **Issue `READY FOR REFACTORING EXECUTION`** on exact post-repair catalog SHA with operator authorization.

---

## Explicit non-claims

- No runtime parity, production harness execution, or visual capture completeness.
- No whole-branch semantic acceptance (752/7885 inventory reviewed).
- No TASK-001 bootstrap or campaign dispatch authorization.
- BRANCH-01 coordinator witness ([`reaudit-branch-coordinator-integration.md`](reaudit-branch-coordinator-integration.md)) remains valid **bookkeeping**; this witness found **trusted-package projection gaps** not caught by `validate-plan.py`.
